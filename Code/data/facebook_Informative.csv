"i have installed and  uninstalled this several time to get an up to date time line....
",1
"slow, rarely loads anything - pages, photos, comments - nothing, constantly crashes.
",1
"i can't change my covert photo from my phone,  searching for anything is awful, i have to type , then delete, then retype, then it works.
",1
"loading pics and comments take much longer, i.don't like it.
",1
"serious bug dealing with notifications.
",1
"opening app from a notification after its been running in the background for a while results in endless wait loop.
",1
"never shuts down in the background and has no exit button.
",1
"reinstalled to get the share link back bit the churning following a notification is still awful.
",1
"still has issues with check-ins. :|
",1
"after the latest update, i have not been able to post status updates on the first try, even with strong 4g data or wifi.
",1
"generally speaking, the app seems much slower than previous versions.
",1
"i see ""unable to establish a secure connection"" errors often.
",1
"also it refreshes while i'm trying to read updates in my news feed and seems me to top of news feed page so i have to scroll and search for what i was reading.
",1
"facebook crashes at least three times a day on my galaxy s2.
",1
"i constantly clear data, but it still crashes...
",1

",1
"doesn't update correctly, freezes a lot.
",1

",1
"only shows up to 98 likes on a photo
",1
"i wish we could save pics from this app
",1
"does everything you would expect, still needs some work on the approvals for privacy confirmation process.
",1
"but the major issue i have is some background task is grinding my phone to a halt.
",1
"i cant delete comments anymore ever since i updated it ..
",1
"pointless to even have on my phone anymore can't even use it like i should be able to..
",1
"the new update has made it so i continually get network error or no internet connection which is just rubbish.
",1
"after updating my system shuts down, i get errors and i can't post anything.
",1
"will not refresh at all on my droid
",1
"far too slow never loads , cant see anything , 'crap' any time i refresh it goes straight onto my actual internet !!!
",1
"keeps crashing, forcing it to close.
",1
"also you carnt view pictures
",1
"yeah so this app ain't bad i use it more than the browser but that's gonna change, i was wondering why my phone memory was all gone so i decided to uninstall the updates now i got a load more memory, so until you can save this app to the memory card then i'm not using it.
",1
"won't even let me log in!
",1
"for some reason i cannot update my facebook status, leave comments, like things or perform any action on the mobile device that actually works.
",1
"keeps losing conection, therefore uninstalling updates
",1
"on my nexus seven tablet, nothing loads.
",1
"i simply get a network error message.
",1
"dear facebook,  please stop prompting me to add friends every friggin time i open your app.
",1
"it worked perfectly fine for me until yesturday when i was on my laptop and changed my password, it logged me off my phone so i logged in with the new password and it kept saying error.
",1
"can't remove comments anymore.
",1
"once more will ask me this app to find friends from phone contacts list i will remove it i swear.

",1
"keeps playing up freezing lots of force close coming up come on fb sort it out i use it everyday and everyday i have problems
",1
"been having issues with newsfeed refresh prior to that.
",1
"now it tells me i have a single sign-on error, which even the great google search has not given me any clues on how to fix.
",1
"it will sign in, but won't sync anything and won't post anything so it's basically useless for my purposes.
",1
"so u have to ask me if i want to use my contacts to find friends multiple times a day.
",1
"can't type two words without the thing crashing...
",1
"the only complaint i have is that it has problems loading pics.
",1
"it's slow to load (probably because it's searching my 'phone for stuff) .
",1
"wants access to my 'photos, contacts, their birthdays and so much more!!!
",1
"i cant share my location :/:=
",1

",1
"the problem is it is constantly syncing and that drains battery  uninstall for an hour and you will notice huge increase in battery life
",1
"it kicks me out once a day and drains my battery completely.
",1
"my facebook is even slower than it already was before.
",1

",1
"well i have top of the range phone,  fastest internet in the uk and this app fails constantly, how can a company this large not create a working application is beyond me,  slow, pictures and comments regularly fail to load, constant network errors and to top it off facebook fail to respond to these issues...
",1
"when trying to watch a youtube video through fb, the option to watch through the youtube app is gone.
