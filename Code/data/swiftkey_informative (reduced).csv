Review,Relevant
"And I want swift key to save the words I type.
",1
"I think it could do with a bit more customization...
",1
"And a few more settings for example, after I insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after..It would be good to be able to turn that off.
",1
"Also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
",1
"I really would like to see Chinese language integration to be developed.
",1
"Very annoying to switch with other input methods.
",1
"Does not work with S-Pen on Galaxy Note 2
",1
"I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
",1
"Last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
",1
"Used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
",1
"It WAS awesome until the layout was changed.
",1
"It may work for large displays but NOT phones with cases on them!
",1
"I hate the new slide punctuation bar!
",1
"Bring smaller space bar back!
",1
"You need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database. This way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!!!
",1
"When your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open SwiftKey.
",1
"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",1
"Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
",1
"Im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for Chinese either,  over rated.
",1
"Wish I could customize the layout, then I would give 5 stars.
",1
"Awesome keyboard just lags with Google takes forever to show up.
",1
"I like how you did pumpkin for Halloween can we get a Christmas theme.
",1
"Because of missing of Macedonian language!
",1
"Ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work..
",1
"I also don't like that you can't use swear words.
",1
"I'm 23, please let me use what words I want to use.
",1
"I am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
",1
"Swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.
",1
"I find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
",1
"I have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
",1
"Also, I should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
",1
"It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
",1
"If this language/font were to be added, SwiftKey would win the award for best Android app.
",1
"After having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
",1
"But very glitchy on Google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key...
",1
"Only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
",1
"Very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
",1
"Always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
",1
"Until I updated to Jelly Bean, I would give this app 5 stars.
",1
"However, following the update on my S3 to Jelly Bean, it now reverts to the Samsung keyboard as the default every time I restart the phone.
",1
"From my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until Jelly Bean is updated to 4.1.2.
",1
"I just need Chinese!!!
",1
"Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
",1
"Keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too...
",1
"Just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
",1
"As stated before SwiftKey does not load after a reboot. It has to be disabled an re enable again.
",1
"Great keyboard and prediction but needs SWIPE function for portrait mode and better customization
",1
"Update: Using on the LG Optimus G and the cursor KEEPS  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
",1
"But can't personalized with fb..
",1
"Uninstalled until I can save it to the SD card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
",1
"This app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my GS3
",1
"Give me a red version of the ""holo"" theme and you'll get 5 stars.
",1
"The only thing I do hate is when I enter a full stop then  space it automatically In puts (I) so my sentences start with I when I'm typing fast.
",1
"Used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my GS3 it will not hold as default :'-(
",1
"I would love to more themes, the current themes are great but I love customising my phone.
",1
"Wheres the clipboard button?
",1
"This auto correct is illogical sometimes.
",1
"When I type ""just""  I don't mean ""justified"".
",1
"It will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
",1
"Was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my Samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!!
",1
"I don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a Samsung galaxy tablet 10.1
",1
"Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
",1
"Please add a few themes frequently.
",1
"I love this keyboard,  but I notice a significant decrease in my battery life when I use it.
",1
"It would be perfect if there was a delete key!
",1
"I would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
",1
"As it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
",1
"Love it but needs emoji support now
",1
"Pretty good,  I get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what I actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
",1
"Just wish it had more themes.
",1
"One like Holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
",1
"Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
",1
"I love this app best $3 I've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
",1
"The one and only problem I have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
",1
"I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
",1
"This app is okay except that the keys are loud when I type, so if I'm working or hunting I have to change the settings.
",1
"And if I'm just not finding how to change the setting I apologize but I've looked everywhere on the phone
",1
"Needs more themes!
",1
"Love the "".com""  button but I wish it were in a different place. Maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
",1
"You need more themes..
",1
"It's a great keyboard,  I just get board with the limited options
",1
"It's useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard.
",1
"In the Dvorak layout, the lowercase 'M' & 'W' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press. The 'W' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
",1
"This would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the ""com"" button while in a browser renders it nearly useless. Hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
",1
"I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
",1
"I the only reason I give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
",1
"Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
",1
"Just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient...
",1
"1 - The keyboard reverts to the original Android Keyboard every time the USB storage becomes disconnected.
",1
"Every time I hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, I have to re-enable it via the Android OS Settings.
",1
"Great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
",1
"Numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
",1
"I don't need it suggesting an odometer reading I'll never see again.
",1
"It would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
",1
"But could you guys add a swiping option?
",1
"If I take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
",1
"Needs improvement in Arabic language support
",1
"My only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most Samsung galaxy s3
",1
"The only weird thing I encountered was on my RAZR while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
",1
"Amazing app, although I wish there were more themes to choose from.
",1
"It doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
",1
"An example is when you type something on Google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
",1
"The same happens in some contact names fields such as Gmail, GOSMS Pro, Any.do. Etc.
",1
"I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text...like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3 and way more Update;
",1
"giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
",1
"whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
",1
"i have tried to ask if possible to add ""numbers"" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog... but no one answer, nobody care...
",1
"I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language...
",1
"I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
",1
"This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
",1
"Just at least one of all the major colors. ESPECIALLY RED!
",1
"Please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
",1
"It always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, I wish I hadn't paid for this before I knew there was a free version
",1
"Have turned off as does not support pen entered text on Samsung note 2.
",1
"Have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
",1
"If you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
",1
"I want more color fonts
",1
"Why is there no Tab key?
",1
"But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
",1
"I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The only complaint I do have are a couple of bugs.
",1
"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",1
"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
",1
"It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",1
"Fatal support for Polish.
",1
"I really dislike how it fails to show predictions during Web browser use.
",1
"There are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
",1
"Totally annoying when I'm used to typing as best I can and picking predictions from the list. At least please give us the option to turn it on / off.
",1
"The only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
",1
"Great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
",1
"However, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
",1
"It's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type URLs into text messages.
",1
"The only thing I really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
",1
"I'm used to typing correctly in the first place so I add the space myself and SwiftKey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
",1
"I want to turn predictions completely OFF, but can't?
",1
"5 stars if could turn off predictions.
",1
"I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
",1
"Just add emojis and more themes.
",1
"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",1
"Would like S Pen support for Galaxy Note 2 so I don't have to swap when writing documents.
",1
"But the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the Samsung at all..
",1
"And when I'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.. It hits the. com
",1
"Whenever I try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together... Why is that?
",1
"Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
",1
"Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
",1
"Emoji support.
",1
"Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
",1
"This keyboard is amazing but the only problem I have with it is that when I use Google drive it slows down and lags SO much.
",1
"I just wish they would add swipe
",1
"Would like to see a couple more themes, but I have no complaints as the Holo theme is gorgeous.
",1
"I think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram..
",1
"A ridiculous amount of RAM!
",1
"Please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by Google for nexus.
",1
"When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
",1
"Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
",1
"Loved Swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
",1
"A lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
",1
"The app also has trouble downloading the language packs ...
",1
"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",1
"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",1
"Love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my S3
",1
"But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
",1
"Edit: The keyboard stop predicting when I am in Any.do, Facebook web browser and several other applications that I couldn't remember.
",1
"Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
",1
"However,  every time I close all apps and ram memory and I go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with SwiftKey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
",1
"Long story short I have to go change the options to have SwiftKey on every time I want to text.
",1
"Suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
",1
"I wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme For your phone.
",1
"Won't start automatically on GS3 however.
",1
"But it is not compatible with 4.1.1  So frustrated.
",1
"Split keyboard does NOT work on the Note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
",1
"I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
",1
"The keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
",1
"Most notably Google now.... it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
",1
"I wish there will be more themes added
",1
"Please integrate swype.
",1
"Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
",1
"Prediction does not work anymore.
",1
"I only wish they had more color scheme.
",1
"With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
",1
"I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
",1
"I was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did NOT import.
",1
"The settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
",1
"Very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
",1
"Since I updated my S3 to Kelly Bean sometimes SwiftKey is not even activating when I go to text or type.
",1
"I have to exit whatever I'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as I said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ICS.
",1
"I love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when I I'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service I thought it was my phone but now I have the note 2 n same thing..
",1
"I just hate how when I click the 123 icon on the keyboard I hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular S3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
",1
"5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
",1
"I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
",1
"I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
",1
"Would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
",1
"Drawback, could do with more skins.
",1
"Great keyboard only issue I have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so I have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
",1
"Was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects...
",1
"Feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work...
",1
"Can't go without this keyboard anymore, though I'd still love to be able to disable gestures
",1
"It does occasionally stop typing.
",1
"Kinda laggy when opening and closing..
",1
"Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
",1
"The Arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
",1
"Can't remember my email address.
",1
"Has a problem remembering simple words.
",1
"Please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
",1
"I used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
",1
"Namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
",1
"Pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
",1
"Sometimes word prediction doesn't show up. Have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
",1
"really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
",1
"I would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
",1
"I have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
",1
"English, of course, but with Korea prediction and everything?
",1
"The beta edition for Thai has been expired. Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
",1
"My only flaw is since the jelly bean update if I have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
",1
"It works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
",1
"something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
",1
"But I would love a cleaner looking interface.
",1
"Would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
",1
"Frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
",1
"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",1
"Resets after boot or restart.
",1
"Will not set itself as default keyboard.
",1
"I recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been HORRIBLE.
",1
"The keyboard is horribly laggy.
",1
"I've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
",1
"Only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
",1
"Only complaint: no swype mode.
",1
"Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
",1
"Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
",1
"Due to error 941 this is bs. Cannot refund either
",1
"Wouldn't install on my gs3
",1
"I just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
",1
"It does not install. Error 941
",1
"I enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words I put in.
",1
"And I'd like to see more, newer themes.
",1
"The only thing that I can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
",1
"I just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
",1
"Bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
",1
"Every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
",1
"As mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
",1
"I sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
",1
"They updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly. How about a few more?
",1
"It would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
",1
"Developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
",1
"I would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
",1
"But after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
",1
"But since I root my phone, I constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
",1
"It feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
",1
"I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
",1
"The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
",1
"Best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
",1
"Amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
",1
"Predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
",1
"Spell check randomly stops working.
",1
"Prediction will sometimes turn off when I sleep the phone.
",1
"Need S-Pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
",1
"Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
",1
"If you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, I will give you 5 stars.
",1
"The back-spacing on the keyboard is a bit slow. I wish I could adjust it.
",1
"This work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until I pull the battery
",1
"Just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
",1
"Just add swype pleeease
",1
"Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is I can not use swype as on the Samsung keyboard.
",1
"SK3 was working flawlessly until the AT&T JB update for S3 recently came out.
",1
"When locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
",1
"Also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.
",1
"Will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
",1
"I would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys. And when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
",1
"I've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the Samsung keyboard.
",1
"(I still hope for some hearts :D)
",1
"I do wish it supported Japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
",1
"Plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
",1
"Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
",1
"C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
",1
"It doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
",1
"Would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
",1
"atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, I'd really like a quieter option!
",1
"wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
",1
"Used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the Swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with Android jelly bean.
",1
"As much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone. Crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
",1
"But I wish it used less memory!
",1
"The word ""it's"" is almost impossible and always comes out as ""is"".
",1
"Also could you allow use of could words?
",1
"Please integrate learning from WhatsApp Messenger as well.
",1
"At the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
",1
"Sometimes wish it had more themes though.
",1
"Only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
",1
"However the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
",1
"Often times when I hit the ""A"" key I hit the shift key.
",1
"I can't download the language pack. It's the same error over and over again.
",1
"Good app but the Turkish dictionary is very insufficient. It doesn't contain many basic words.
",1
"I request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, Google and Facebook.
",1
"Suggested words were never accurate either.
",1
"It's good but I'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
",1
"The best,no s-pen detection?
",1
"where is handwriting for s pen?
",1
"My only issue with this and it's a SERIOUS issue with me is that since I got the update for my S III to 4.1 is that I can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when I type. The phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what I do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
",1
"would love more themes!
",1
"But, it's been almost a year and I think one new theme was added!
",1
"Come on guys... Get on board the theme wagon!
",1
"Would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
",1
"This by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to JB, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
",1
"As mentioned by others, Google search has slowed with the keyboard not appearing for several seconds when using this keyboard.
",1
"I have had this keyboard since I first got the Evo, I just love it, I wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!
",1
"SwiftKey please add: Swipe, personal dictionary and prediction for email and name.
",1
"Not working with jelly bean
",1
"Some of the predictive text functions are annoying but its a good app otherwise.
",1
"Pleeeaassseee come out with more themes....
",1
"I'd still like an editable dictionary of the words that it has learned.
",1
"Closes while I type.
",1
"Puts in wrong words when I have the right words and completely omits words when I type too fast.
",1
"Oh and the voice recognition of voice to text barely works.
",1
"After updating to jb, there is no heptic intensity control. It's always full blast.
",1
"But i don't like keyboard skin model, if you can make keyboard skin like original keyboard, itu Will great
",1
"Just updated my AT&T galaxy s3 from os 4.0.4 to the new 4.1.1 jelly bean and my paid version of swift key 3 no longer works and keeps force closing fix this please??
",1
"If you just make it possible to sync user dictionary with Google drive so we can have it with Multiple devices (that will let you have the new words you typed in all of your devices) and don't lose them if you wipe or change the device.
",1
"Syncing will be great in background with every time the keyboard shows up and disappears.
",1
"Or please add a way to customize your own theme.

"swiftkey is really a good keyboard.. but not perfect for me, hope can improve by adding chinese language.
",1
"besides, slide to delete not so sensitive, hope can improve
",1
"Updated to Jelly Bean. I have all haptic feedback turned off on my phone, but after the update it has been turned back on only using SwiftKey.
",1
"It's draining my battery.
",1
"My phone stoped responding While using the keyboard seince recent update.
",1
"Just improve the polish and french dict. :-)
",1
"This keyboard was stunning on my old Galaxy Ace2 but I now use Galaxy S3 mini running Jelly Bean 4.1 and now Swiftkey will not work.
",1
"The keyboard refuses to pop-up when i require to type ( in all apps including txt, kingsoft office, WhatsApp log-in's etc) and I hve to revert to the Samsung keyboard.
",1
"Regretably had to un-install.
",1
"The swipe down gesture to minimize the keyboard doesn't work very well.
",1
"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",1
"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",1
"we need more themes!! like a red and green one for Christmas!!
",1
"or color personalization
",1
"Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!!
",1
"And I don't want to type in landscape.
",1
"Autocorrect no longer works since they put out swiftkey flow.
",1
"Have noticed a bug with it though (although not sure if this is a bug with the keyboard or with android), whenever my phone runs out of battery or I restart it for any reason, the keyboard defaults to Samsung Keyboard.
",1
"After turning on phone keyboard does not load. Have to go into settings and choose again.
",1
"It misses the hinglish language support.
",1
"It still lags on viber but over all it is amazing but yeah when is SwiftKey Flow coming to this app or making a new one the is the flow version??
",1
"Issue 1: I don't use smileys!! Please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
",1
"Issue 2: Alt keys layout. Couldn't you just set it out like EVERY OTHER KEYBOARD ON THE MARKET!?
",1
"I want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  I want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen. At least give the option to your users.
",1
"This keyboard is amazing for English but it doesn't have a Japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
",1
"The only 'complaint' is that the themes are quite awful.
",1
"When I'm on Facebook I only get the keyboard. No auto correct or word - guess - er.
",1
"Also when I finish a word at the end of a line I can't insert a space bar??
",1
"I love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the Chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
",1
"Slow to minimize on JB Maxx HD update, the functionality however destroys ics/jb keyboard.
",1
"Awesome keyboard needs more haptic feedback and it will be perfect.
",1
"Waiting for chinese support, it's amazing to try this kind of input.
",1
"It would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
",1
"Can you add traditional Chinese?
",1
"The keyboard is now running slow, freezes  takes a while to open and close...
",1
"I love everything about the app except for one thing, I wish there were more theme options.
",1
"I have a galaxy note and the swiping feature doesn't work..
",1
"Love the keyboard but its really slow now
",1
"When I changed it back to the samsung galaxy keyboard it stopped.
",1
"The only complaint is have is that there isn't a customized dictionary.
",1
"It doesn't predict words I use all the time
",1
"Pls update thai language im waiting for the long time
",1
"I deducted one star, however, because it causes crashes with some regularity.
",1
"Needs another simultaneous dictionary.
",1
"Annoying censorship.
",1
"I can understand censoring explicit swearing but words like ""gay"", ""horny"" or ""sex"" get changed into something else.
",1
"""Erection"" gets go changed into ""election"" although the letters aren't even near.
",1
"Also, apparently, dictionaries not too complete.
",1
"""Egyptian"" doesn't exist.
",1
"Writing in Portuguese is a pain.
",1
"since the update when i type, it puts random periods and wrong text.
",1
"I get an error message when I try to install the language pack that says there is a problem with the network connection, make sure your network connection is working, then try again.
",1
"I think the problem may be that this new version of the Note is running Jelly Bean.
",1
"I see that some others running Jelly Bean are also experiencing problems.
",1
"If got Chinese input I will give you 5 star.
",1
"Hope faster get Chinese input!!
",1
"Were need Chinese input!!!
",1
"Normal typing just doesn't cut it any more.
",1
"Normally I would give it only four stars because there are still a few very minor bugs that need ironing out from a power user perspective, but this app is one of the key selling points for Android, in my opinion.
",1
"Why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button? With a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.
",1
"Why does it learn from everything except whatsapp?
",1
"The keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
",1
"Other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, I like my S3 stock keyboard layout more.
",1
"Back to 3 stars until they add an option to disable the key popup !!!
",1
"My only slight annoyance is when the "".com"" key appears. I wish there was an option to hide it, I seem to press it on accident often.
",1
"Also, why does SwiftKey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
",1
"After upgrading to Jelly Bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed...
",1
"I purchased this app because it simply awesome but after I movedto jellybean it'sshowing error crashes and copy and paste optionsare disabled.
",1
"More themes..?
",1
"Works perfect but for some reason it lags when I exit the typing mode.
",1
"Only thing is that if you screw up the last word of a text message and hit send it doesn't fix that last word before sending..
",1
"Please make it fix the last word when we hit send.....
",1
"Could use an update for better keys on 7 inch tablets  Like my nexus 7
",1
"Im one of those people who depend on auto correct and it never works.
",1
"Good keyboard but ''percentage'' symbol missing and not very good performance...
",1
"Thanks forbalways adding words when i hit the space bar and for always learning the wrong way to spell words.
",1
"Would love to see more themes though!
",1
"but no compact QWERTY option which I think is essential in portrait view
",1
"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",1
"Resets after boot or restart.
",1
"more themes would be appreciated dev.
",1
"Please please please revert back to a seperate ""!"" button like in the old version of swiftkey.
",1
"I press ""!"" ""?"" and ""."" way more often than the letter ""q"". It deserves its own place. 1 button for 3 common keys?
",1
"BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR ""!"" AND ""?""!!!
",1
"One thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as I am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes I prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
",1
"The only thing I would add is more customisation options!
",1
"This app is very good w/ English  But Arabic layout is very annoying, Please use Windows layout instead of MAC
",1
"But why does it take up 27 MB of RAM on my Galaxy Nexus?
",1
"The more RAM programs use the less program you can run EFFICIENTLY, slowing down the phone in general.
",1
"Often I notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up RAM for no reason and have to uninstall the Hogs. This is similar to the memory leak problem Firefox has on the desktop.
",1
"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",1
"Arabic letters are rather small
",1
"but uses good amount of ram in background.
",1
"It's a decent keyboard replacement but I feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
",1
"For example typing lowercase free standing ""i"" isn't auto capitalized, typing ""whats"" isn't auto corrected to ""what's"" and so on.
