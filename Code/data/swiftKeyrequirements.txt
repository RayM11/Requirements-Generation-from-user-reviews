# Application Context
This is an app named SwiftKey that offers an alternative keyboard for your smartphone

# User Comments to Analyze
1- I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
2- I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
3- I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
4- This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
5- Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
6- But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
7- Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
8- I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
9- The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
10- Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
11- If you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, I will give you 5 stars.
12- It would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
13- Certainly the best for typing, the only thing I would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
14- As petty as it sounds I would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
15- I like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
16- PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
17- This is an outstanding app and I would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) Swipe functionality and (2) More keyboard themes.
18- Is there anyway swift key can create a red color theme?
19- Add more keyboard skins please!!!
20- It would be nice if they had more keyboard customizing.
21- Add some more themes, keypad and key press tones..
22- Only minor issue I have is I wish there was more themes for the key board
23- It's would be refreshing to see other keyboard themes.
24- PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz
25- very nice keyboard but only thing lacking is choice of themes.
26- almost all themes are with closely spaced keys.
27- you guys shud add more themes like sony keyboard style or iphone style or stock android jellybean look
28- My only gripe is that it doesn't have more black themed keyboard for us AMOLED screen users (to save power!).


# Task
Analyze the comments and extract clear software requirements. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Requirement Types**:
   - **Functional**: Describe what the system should do.
   - **Non-Functional**: Describe how the system should perform (e.g., performance, security, usability).

2. **Requirement Format**:
   - Use the structure: "The system shall [action] [condition/criteria]."
   - Be specific and include measurable criteria where possible.

3. **Examples**:
   - Functional: "The system shall allow users to export reports in PDF format."
   - Non-Functional: "The system shall load all dashboard data in under 2 seconds."
   
4. **Quality Criteria**:
- Atomicity: 1 requirement per feature
- Specificity: Include verifiable metrics/criteria
- Traceability: Link each requirement to specific comments
- Completeness: Cover functional and quality aspects

# Output Format:
## Functional Requirements
- [Requirement description]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [Requirement description]
- [Other...]

## Quality Criteria
- [Specific detail]
- [Traceable links here...]
- [Completeness checks here...]
-...

Now, applying this to the given scenario, let me outline my analysis step by step...

Step 1: Read through all user comments carefully.
I notice that many users are pointing towards adding more themes, especially considering the variety of colors and styles mentioned earlier. They also mention wanting more customization options, which suggests that the system should allow for multiple configurations without compromising on user experience.

Step 2: Identify common patterns in the user feedback.
- Many users emphasize the importance of additional themes, suggesting that the solution needs to cater to diverse preferences beyond just the primary color.
- Some users request emoticons, indicating interest in visual enhancements beyond basic aesthetics.

Step 3: Break down each comment into its constituent parts.
For example, when someone says, "just need some more themes to choose from," this indicates a desire for increased flexibility in selecting themes for the keyboard.
Similarly, their comment about wanting more customization choices points toward allowing for various settings, such as font selection, size adjustments, etc.

Step 4: Consider the implications of each pattern observed.
Adding more themes implies that the system must provide mechanisms to specify these themes without disrupting the normal operation of the app. Users likely want seamless integration of new features, meaning minimal disruption during the setup process.

Step 5: Determine the type of requirement based on the identified patterns and their implications.
Since themes are customizable and the addition of them does not significantly affect the core functioning, this becomes a functional requirement. However, since users value the number of available options, non-functional constraints may apply, such as limiting the maximum number of themes available.

But looking again at Step 2, some users even went further in requesting additional features beyond styling, like adding a red color theme specifically. This emphasizes the need for greater control over the design rather than just availability.

Thus, combining these insights, it's clear that the problem requires both ensuring enough flexibility in choosing themes while maintaining ease of use across all interactions (shift, Enter, Backspace), and possibly including more advanced features related to design that go beyond merely increasing the number of theme variations.

Now, moving forward, perhaps the first task is to determine whether having more themes is necessary. For instance, considering that some users requested'more customization' choices, it might mean that the current system lacks sufficient parameters or options to accept varied configurations, making more themes desirable.

Moving on, non-functional constraints relate to how well the system handles performance issues—like being too slow—or security concerns. But given the nature of the problem, where users are primarily concerned with aesthetics and responsiveness, perhaps focusing on performance isn't as critical unless there's a significant bottleneck elsewhere.

However, another point to consider is that having more themes implies a larger state space. Each time the user selects a new theme, that action has to be accounted for in the system's processing cycle. Therefore, managing state transitions correctly without introducing unnecessary overhead could be important.

Putting this together, the functional requirement revolves around enabling more configuration via themes, while perhaps having limits placed on the maximum number of themes to prevent excessive computational demands.

Another aspect to explore is whether the existing sorting algorithm allows for more dynamic grouping behaviors. If the default order relies solely on keyboard shortcuts without considering various user-specific contexts, then enhancing that feature with more themes could offer deeper level of customization.

Additionally, thinking about the purpose behind the introduction, SwiftKey aims to balance between efficiency and aesthetics; thus, incorporating more aesthetic freedom within a computationally efficient framework might require smart optimizations or state management techniques.

In summary, after analyzing the user comments, several potential requirements emerge:

1. **Enabling Multiple Themes:** Allow varying levels of customization by providing numerous distinct themes to select from.
2. **Handling Custom Emoticons/Signatures:** Incorporate features that enable visually enhanced user interactions, such as extended symbols or signatures.
3. **Enhancing Keyboard Clarity and Customization:** Introduce elements that allow the user to adjust keyboard layout complexity, ensuring easier access to frequently used keys regardless of shifts or lowercase inputs.
4. **Imposing Additional Constraints on Performance:** Implement safeguards to ensure smooth execution of tasks involving themes without causing delays.
5. **Reducing Processing Overhead Due to Theme Changes:** Optimize the system's algorithms so that changes in themes don’t incur excessive computation costs.

Given these observations, breaking them down into structured functional and non-functionality requirements would help guide the development process effectively.

Now, moving on, let’s tackle each part one by one according to the provided query structure.

## Functional Requirements
- The system shall allow users to select from a variety of themes to configure their keyboard display.
  
## Non-Functional Requirements
- The system shall maintain a responsive and smooth interaction despite the presence of multiple themes.
- The system shall support the inclusion of custom emoji or signature generation enhance user input experiences.

## Quality Criteria
- The system shall manage the transition of themes smoothly during the initial setup phase without disrupting core functionalities.
- The interface shall visually accommodate the selection of up to three themes with distinct color palettes.
- The system shall implement constraints to limit the maximum number of themes allowed to prevent overwhelming computational resources.
- The implementation shall ensure that the insertion and deletion of custom emojis or signatures follow predictable and efficient processes.
