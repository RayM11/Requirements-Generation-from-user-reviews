",1
"could use some extra boosts more characters and rewards for finishing a objective and not a level
",1
"the update turned the temple run less nice in control.
",1
"great game but it is a little jerky and skips little parts frequently.
",1
"as i open it , it just displays the opening screen and after a minute or so , it disappears and comes back to the homesceeen .
",1

",1
"i purchased coins over 2 weeks ago and have not recieved them
",1
"its a good game but it lags so much and it makes me end up dying!
",1
"this game on my sony phone is completely laggy and i hate it, if it wasnt so addictive i would've uninstalled it already
",1
"very good but better will be if the game has more than one temple and artefacts or idols to steal and different monsters to run from
",1
"on my lg optimus elite it glitches a bunch and if you could put a sensitivity toggle bar in that would be great because i have to turn my phone completely horizontal for it to recognize that i'm turning and leaning which makes for a frustrating game.
",1
"the objective gold miner stuck in the middle but i already reach 500k coins.
",1
"it was a great game until the update, i updated and now i have to turn my tablet and it almost turns in a 180 degree angle.

",1
"i would give more stars but toy can't adjust the sensitivity, witch is a big down fall.
",1
"ratingfive i rated this game a 5 because it is a cool and exciting game the only problem i'm having with this game is once i download it i can play it for as long as i want as long as i don't exit or close the game when i do close it i can't get it to open again it only takes me to the first screen the one that says imangi studios then it automaticatly takes me back to the previous screen i was on for example if i'm on the menu screen of my phone i go back to it can u please fix that or tell me what it could be

",1
"gets crashing on my htc plz fix
",1
"overall way better except that on my phone after every run it resets the amount of coins i collect, don't know if this is intentional but would be better if it would reset every turn.

"this game take a long time to load
",1
"would be 5 star however tilt action has quite a dramatic lag and can effect your gameplay potential.
",1
"game starts the shuts down on milestone
",1
"but its really hard to buy upgrades and what not.
",1
"the only thing wrong is that the magnet power up and the coin power up do not work.

",1
"the game is amazing yet the objectives of the game is kinda boring.
",1
"it throws me out of the game while it is starting up :(

",1
"the power up don't last long
",1
"sometimes after u cross 2500 m its glitchy
",1
"tilting my phone isn't as responsive as the original horrible game stick to temple run 1

"theirs a lot of lag for my version of the gs3
",1
"the sensitivity of the swipes is not good.

"best game ever but sometimes freezes
",1
"i had 141 gems and later found that i only have 41 remaining.
",1
"so i lost 100 gems with no reason.
",1
"it slowed down blocking the screen.
",1
"please bring back the last animation.
",1
"so far i think the game is pretty good but when an ability reaches 10000 coins to purchase the next level it just takes my coins, doesn't upgrade ability and comes up with a promt to purchase more coins.
",1
"i was expecting a more difficult mode tough.
",1
"but i suddenly lost all my data, hours of play, and that's unnaceptable.
",1
"sooooooo everything that i unlocked and all my achievements disappeared.
",1
"the game is good but i'm facing a small problem, the coins automatically becomes zero after i collect 1000+ coins.
",1
"love it but for my phone it keeps freezing and unfreezing and it messes up the game.
",1

"its obviously better than any other games of its kind subway rail rush or d original temple run but my objectives are not working like i got to 5 lakh lifetime coins still the mission is not clearing.
",1
"some issues with tilt response in the minecart,  but no major issues beyond that.

",1
"but now its automatically going to pause the game.
",1
"i was getting addicted to it then i stopped playing it to let my phone charge then when its all charged i go back to play it again and it won't even start up!

"if you're using an ability such as the coin magnet, and you run across another and pick it up before time runs out, the first game would renew the time remaining on the ability, but this game doesn't. it's worthless, and tends to punish you for getting upgrades that make your abilities last just long enough that it hadn't run out before you get to the next one.

",1
"only thing that sucks is that you have to go back to the beginning as opposed to starting where you left off.
",1
"it was fine until it updated a few days ago after that it erased all my saved game and had to completely restart and it freezes up on me
",1
"a little of hang time in some transition.
",1
"game is very fun and addictive but is extremely laggy on my samsung stratosphere.

",1
"iv played this on other devices but i dont understand why it doesnt work on my phone it stays on the loading screen and after awhile it takes me out of the app please help and yes its compatible on my phone

"i'll give it 5 stars if it would work for my lg thrill i never get past the picture before the start menu.
",1
"this game was pretty fun at the beginning but after 15 minutes of playing it got really boring plus way to many ads.
",1
"i have obviously read in some rates and whenever i first open the app, it force closes.
",1
"i just bought 50,000 coins this weekend and they aren't on my game wtf come on man fix this
",1
"only suggestion: make it so that if you get a second power up while you are already using one,  it is not ignored.
",1
"game hangs if i press physical back button when re-incarnate with a gem option comes.
",1
"one of the objectives of lifetime 500,000 coins is stuck even though i have more than 600k. this happened after the same objective came twice.
",1
"it's fun but it always exits for no reason.
",1
"the double tap to use the power up when the bar gets full only works 1 out of 5 times  on the nexus 10 but on the siii the double tap to engage power up works perfectly fine, i don't understand.
",1
"im a level 8 n the app wont open please fix with the next update i love this game but can't  it
",1
"the lag associated with the initial start of the game is annoying, but otherwise a great game all around.
",1
"the only downside is that it is very repetitive  and the powerups are very dull,so at times the game os not fun.
",1
"objectives not being updated accordingly
",1
"i love the graphics on this game but for some reason it doesn't keep count of how many coins i get/have it always says a lower number than what i started the run with dk if anybody else has this problem actually thinking bout deleting it becuz its irreating me too much not being able to get my upgrades
",1
"it's annoying when it is down to the luck of level generation whether or not i get a good score.
",1
"the game is great but its always lagging on my droid 3.......
",1
"now the problem is i can play the game once after that everytime i try to open the game it backs out 2 my home page.....
",1
"in order for me to get to level 9 i had to beat an objective but i beat it and it wouldn't say i beat it
",1
"the game will not let me play it on my galaxy s why it do that please fix it
",1
"yea wellllll it's kinda slow.
",1
"my only issue is that the 500,000 and 1,000,000 coin achievements are still bugged so i can't reach lvl 9!
",1
"the game is good but my coins keep getting deleted!!!!!!!!
",1
"the app keeps crashing on my phone, need help.
",1
"a change in the scenery would be nice as running over the same old ground becomes rather boring after awhile.
",1
"the app does not let me load the menu please fix this.
",1
"keeps getting stuck on the imangi studios screen and then returns to my home screen!
",1
"the only things i would want are the power-ups to be able to stack and extend.
",1
"example, picking up a coin magnet, and then picking up another one while the first one is going should extend the length if the power-up, but it does not, at least not the last 5 times i noticed.
",1
"also, i kinda wish that the list of objectives was available, i've had to hit some of the million mark objectives 2 or 3 times because it wasn't active on the list of three objectives.
",1
"i did not get credit for collecting 500000 coins!
",1
"the progress bar froze!
",1
"i hate the fact you can only see 3 objectives at a time.
",1
"in addition, i have a glitch that isn't giving me the 500,000 life time coins achievement.
",1
"lastly, i'm experiencing glitches where i'll jump and i then appear way off the map and die
",1
"i paid two times 99 cents each for 5 pack of gemstone n was charged but never got the gems in the game.
",1
"i kind of don't like temple run  2 because it makes you do only three objectives so this is my opion
",1
"takes soooo long to load didn't like it
",1
"5 stars when there are more characters.
",1
"more pick ups?
",1
"the only reason i gaveit 4 stars is because sometime when i am at a high score and going fast it will sometimes lag alittle.
",1
"but it has too many details so that you can't focuse on the game.
",1
"over 500k coins lifetime, but did not get credit for completing objective.

",1
"this wont run on my samsung infuse
",1
"i use a samsung galaxy tab and every time i try to install this app it says 'error(498)' fix this?
",1
"the update was so amazing, it deleted all my temple run 2 data.
",1
"i had trouble swiping and tilting, it was too low for both also when in the mine shaft, when you make a turn, you have to be very fast to tilt the mine cart the other way.
",1
"just wish you could skip objectives.
",1
"so my girlfriend wanted to play as the last chick so we bought the biggest coin pack over a day ago and never got any coins, uninstalling, any game that rips you off.
",1
"would be better if the tilt was more responsive and the powerups renewed though.

"i had the game and enjoyed it for about a week and then lost my save and have to restart to 0/10 is my rating

"please develop more stages, tasks, and scenery.
",1

",1
"though i have completed the objective of five lakh life time coins but it is not showing in   the completed objective

",1
"it was working perfectly and i had so many things then randomly it reset me back to having nothing.
",1
"this app is really fun but its slow alot.

"5 stars when you add tilt sensitivity, otherwise one of the most addicting games out there
",1
"random visual skips(pop ins) hurt game play sometimes.
",1
"whenever i try to open it it would go to the play store

"everytime i click temple run it goes to my home screen

"so addictive but i have a kyocera hydro and i had to delete and reinstall because it would freeze now i have boo problems with it and i can not stay off it
",1
"it start off slow for as the movement.
",1
"keeps losing most of my coins - so cannot upgrade.
",1
"this game is fun and addicting as hell but most of the time (and especially after i reach a few million points) it starts lagging like crazy and i end up dying because the game doesn't detect my swipe.

"i'm not sure if it was meant to be this way, but the power meter doesn't fill up any faster when my coin value is doubled or tripled.

"it doesn't make any sense to me why the power meter would count the actual coin number, rather than the coin values.

"still crashing please help i haven't played it once on my samsung galaxy tablet  please!

"it say always download is unsuccessful, try again

"major bugs with achievements getting stuck. like lifetime 500,000 coins at ~60% when i have 600,000

"can you guys make an update that involves more characters to work towards
",1
"this application opens but after two minutes on the imangi studios screen it automatically shuts down.
",1
"it wont open when i download it i dont know why
",1
"then i appreciate the upgrades but the sensitivity is really bad and you guys didn't add the option to change it like tr1 .
",1
"also there are times when swiping makes the character jump off the cliff or slide when i swipe to turn.

",1
"awesome game, wil gv it 5 star if tilting prob is solved.

",1
"a bit difficult to control
",1
"awsome but the score must increase fast
",1
"started the game up today and everything i've worked for is gone!
",1
"i'm annoyed by the popup reminding me to rate this.
",1
"why can't this game be completely muted?
",1
"there is always a sound when the character is running.
",1
"fun and addicting game, but every time i update i'm hoping you'll have fixed the major problems with the objectives, but no luck

",1
"i have redownloaded this 3 different times using three different internet connections.

"have to tilt my phone way too much, stutters after 5k meters and crashes often.
",1
"it's fun but it lags, its harder and the tilting is really hard.

"does not start up on my thunderbolt.
",1
"one problem - we have to tilt mobile too much to make the character go in the side.
",1
"when i went to play this game it came up big on my screen and i couldn't play it because i couldn't see the road ahead.
",1
"original was better, dont like new graphics, still same concept but trying too hard i think
",1
"the only problem is you need to tilt to extreme right/left to avoid falling.
",1
"the game would be near perfect if there were an option to change the sensitivity as it's a bit insensitive to my phone.
",1
"have some lag issues on p970 at the lowest graphics which effects the game dramatically.
",1
"i need lower graphics.
",1
"good game but it crashes alot for me.

"this is a great game but sometimes it takes away your coins
",1
"luv it but needs more places to go looks like its goin in circle
",1
"i understand it's difficult to optimize the game for all android phones as there are several, several phones, but it would be nice if the lag could be fixed on the samsung galaxy s iii.
",1
"seems slightly buggy, can we get a sensitivity or accelerometer calibrator?
",1
"temple run 2 doesn't open for my phone it stays on the first part and exits out of the game i have the samsung infuse please fix
",1
"good, but sometimes it takes forever to load so when i turn and such, i die, because it doesn't do it right then.
",1
"rubbish not open in xperia x10i

"wtf the game takes ages for the points to go up the ziplines are terrible :d
",1
"love the game, android  v2.2.2, shows imangi and then closes, no warning, no force close, just closes, please fix imangi!

"can't tilt left to right, game is a bit too much
",1
"it sits on the loading screen the whole time or just exits out of the game.
",1

",1
"the screen of the game is too big and i can't see where i'm running.
",1
"love the game but recently it started to freeze and close when you try to use a gem for save me.
",1
"this is my favourate game on android but it was running smoothly before but after unlocking characters and upgrades it started lagging.
",1
"good but it should have adjustable sensitivity in the settings.
",1
"would've given a 5 star if the option to adjust sensitivity and the magnet powerup will not overlap with the magnet pickup.
",1
"very fun, but every time i use a save me in a mineshaft it crashes and i lose all progress from that run.
",1
"the game freezes and force closes quite a bit.
",1
"this is a very addicting game, but there are a few issues concerning powerups and placement.
",1
"installed but not fit on qvga screen whyy
",1
"hate that the magnet doesn't multiply coins but its still good.

"the turning is slow.
",1
"it takes full second or more to turn.
",1

",1
"very fun but its too laggy on my neo v ics

"i've just downloaded this app twice and it doesn't work on my samsung galaxy tab gt p1010.
",1
"it's a good game, but not as smooth as temple run 1.
",1
"superb game but need to force close frequently that's why 3star otherwise 5star
",1
"lags a tiny bit sometimes but i'm sure optimization will fix that.
",1
"and its a little confusing on what to upgrade and stuff.
",1
"there was no explanation of how powerups work, why is it that when i spend 20 gems to max out the magnet powerup, after one game goes down by  half?
",1
"this is game is way addicting and super fun but i hate when i try to use my gems sometimes that it crashes and doesnt save my progress.
",1
"i was at 10500 when it crashed last no joke.
",1
"does not fit my screen right at all!
",1
"i purchased a set of gold and it still hasn't shown up in my game, several days later.

"i didn't  find  exit button  on  tab2  then  i   have  to  open task manager  and  close   but  i  like   this game   i request  to  play store  to    make  exit   button
",1
"i hate the little ride on the tracks but it makes the game harder.
",1
"i don't know how the game was because the ""package file was invalid""
",1
"anytime i upgrade the 'boost' power up, however, i go to upgrades or anywhere else and the spent gems are still gone and the power up remains not upgraded.
",1
"its fine and smooth, maybe more characters?
",1
"graphics stuck most of the time and i lose the game.
",1
"till now thiz iz the most addicted game but i suggest if there is slope down.

",1
"oh ya  the app freeze when i open the privacy button.
",1
"doesn't load, closes out on its own.
",1
"sensitivity is a little off sometimes on my note 2, hopefully this upgrade will fix it.

",1
"ok on my tmobile sidekick for droid i can play the 1st temple run but this one it freezes when it is loading i haven't been able to play part 2 and i want too real bad please try to figure it out

"lag constantly kills me.
",1
"just keeps force closing plz fix
",1
"whole screen is filled with icons only please fix it.

"on the galaxy s 4g the game wount start up.
",1
"it says error download ekek aww

"good graphics but lags game resolution.
",1
"this would be a five if it didn't crash my tablet so much
",1
"however, so far i have experienced severe lagging (the screen even refreshes sometime while running and i'm popped onto a completely different track).
",1
"besides the face that when i try to open it often it doesnt open and glitches
",1
"won't load game now.
",1
"i hag a motorola blur and all i get to is the start up screen even with the new patch it doesn't work

"i could have given it 5 stars but the guy does not move left n rite fix it i will give u 5 stars i have even uninstalled it twice n installed it again
",1
"my only problem in playing is i always lag.
",1
"my coin doubler does not work why is that?
",1
"i really enjoy the game and its a huge improvement but the lag messes with the game play to much.
",1
"it ran perfect at first but then it started lagging bad throughout the game and i always die because of it!
",1
"i've finished the 1m meters objective, but it's still there for me to finish.
",1
"maybe it's a result of my finishing one of the objectives when it was shown twice.
",1
"i have put on the new update, i have completed more than 1 million meters but my 1 million metres objective is struck and doesnt move.
",1
"if you're trying to jump a gap, and you hit the edge, it sometimes does a weird thing where you fly to the right or left.
",1
"i can be playing but then run off the cliff because the game lagged and i didn't see it coming.
",1
"but takes too long when i click on the app to play but besides dat, wonderful
",1
"have trouble sliding sometimes.
",1
"needs tilt option
",1
"just find the ads irritating
",1
"i wish that when my battery is dying and the warning comes on the game would pause like in some of my other apps.

"-i cannot see my stats, making it impossible to brag to my friends.
",1
"still skips frames even after update.
",1
"i was sooooo bummed that this game came out for the iphone first.
",1
"the designers really hated colors !?!?
",1
"but when the girl dies does she really have to sound so.
",1
"basically the same game as t1, almost nothing new.
",1
"temple run 2 is a excellent game but there's same problem in playing my st15i.
",1
"have an s3 and this game still runs like crap.
",1
"for one is it just me or is this game a bit stiff compared to the first one.
",1
"this one is so bright and colourful it makes the obstacles unspottable sometimes.
",1
"really great game but kind of jerky on turns
",1
"everytime i open it it will show the imangi studios logo for about a minute then it will just slose the app.
",1
"randomized levels add to the replayability.
",1
"downloading error
",1
"i have passed 500.000 in life coins, but the objective progress on passing that limit of coins, is locked on about 50%.
",1
"however it is quite annoying when it goes to -1 on the gems can't it just stay at 0 when you don't have enough gems to save you once dying.
",1
"only hiccup is that the later challenges are almost impossible (10,000,000 lifelong coins. are you kidding me?).
",1
"game is great, but the crashes are annoying enough to kill the experience.
",1
"considering i can't even download it this is stupid
",1
"it keeps on freezing when i have a high score
",1
"i like the game but i wish that when i get multiple objectives on one round,that it would check them all off.
",1
"it wont let me download it.
",1
"only thing is the tilt on tablets on the phone it works perfect but the tilt on tablets is unstable but hey at least we got temple run 2 been waiting a long time for this :d
",1
"tilt sensitivity s very less wen compared to first version.
",1
"i like the game its awesome but it lags a lot and slow on my phone and i have android 4.0.4 and a 1.4 processer idk why it does that but its fun other then that and they also take coins away if you don't use them sucks
",1
"for some reason when i launched the game today, none of my scores were saved, all power ups gone n back to level 1.
",1
"hoping the next update makes the tilts more responsive.
",1
"does not work everytime i try to play it it only loads the ingram sign and then crashes and i have deleted it 2 time and downloaded it 3 time still don't work and this is on the lg thrill
",1
"focecloses sometimes other than that it's an okay game.
",1
"yeah its great but now it wont even openand when it does it closes but i like graphics

",1
"i love thee game really captive and well crafted but coin denominations change frequently and minor glitches have caused it to crash but overall nice game oh yeah the coins keep resetting!
",1
"now its just stuck there however the 1,000,000 coin achievement is still increasing.
",1
"the game opens with the splash screen, like it's supposed to, but then it freezes, vibrates for a second and the app crashes.
",1
"this game is okay, but every time i pass level 5 and continue, it resets the game to back to level 5 the next day.
",1
"it tends to skip and freeze every now and then.
",1
"every time i open it, it ends up closing right out of it .
",1
"the objectives given is totally insane.
",1
"its really good and fun etc, but its too easy and some of the objectives aren't reasonable.
",1
"i had lots of coins and it just all disaperd dont buy if it doning that otherwise good game
",1
"by far the thing that needs to be fixed most urgently is power up timing.
",1
"temple run 2 is addicting and fun but i had to force close a few times so i uninstalled and installed again :d
",1
"same issue with coins and the worst thing, the graphics are draggy and jerky.
",1
"i've never gotten a chance  to play it on my phone because it force closes every time !

"fun game, but sometimes lags
",1
"i have 1,000,000 life time meters, but the objective isn't updating.
",1
"it won't even work every time i click it it sends me back to my home screen can any one help
",1
"its fun and addicting, just kinda slow sometimes.
",1
"it shuts down automatically after the i screen please fix i really love temple run n i played 2 on my lil sisters ipod n i loved it please please fix

"does anyone else experience this delay?
",1
"to slow to donwload
",1
"don't know whats happing but now when i tilt my phone to any side the character does not tilt with the phone.
",1
"i didn't get the extra coins that i purchased.
",1
"i have samsung galaxy s and i can't even get the game to load it stops at the big i thing this needs to be fixed.
",1
"the game freezes when open it
",1
"while under the influence of a power up if you get a second power up of the same kind it should extend the time of the power up.
",1
"the gameplay is bit easier now (which i liked about it) but has some glitches of its own, like the player even jumped off the track on left and right.
",1
"but tilting is bad
",1
"force closes at the loading page. :/
",1
"the game freezes when i am playing and cause my person to die even though she isnt even close to hitting anything.

",1
"it gets stuck and won't take any screen input.
",1
"fix the lag issues and you'll get 5 stars

"download it it starts to load then screen goes black then it exits
",1
"all my stats, powers, everything back to zero.

"game is good now, new challenges but definitely lags a lot and hangs after a little long run.
