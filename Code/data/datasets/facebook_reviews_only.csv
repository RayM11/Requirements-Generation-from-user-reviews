"each update becomes increasingly intrusive into your personal life.
"
"can't turn off location tracking...
"
"so sick and tired of getting network error messages when at the same time, facebook web works fine!
"
"i always have to close the app from my multi-tasking so that the next time i open it, it will hopefully load my newsfeed.
"
"pictures and new stories load pretty slowly.
"
"my biggest pet peeve is that i can't ""like""
"
"things 95% of the time, or it takes five or six taps to register the ""like.""
"
"notifications frequently take me to something irrelevant.
"
"this is constantly having problems loading comments.
"
"i can almost never get them to show on pictures, status updates or anything else.
"
"has anyone else been having issues with constant force close?
"
"can't post since last update.
"
"also, they need to make it so that you can hide posts from certain people like the website does.
"
"the app is good & all, but some images in my news feed can only be previewed instead of opened.
"
"occasionally, the app says that the image can't be opened & please try again later.
"
"move to sd please
"
"news feed shows no pics...
"
"the only thing about the newer app i hate is the ""like"" and ""comment"" feature is broken.
"
"i have installed and  uninstalled this several time to get an up to date time line....
"
"slow, rarely loads anything - pages, photos, comments - nothing, constantly crashes.
"
"i can't change my covert photo from my phone,  searching for anything is awful, i have to type , then delete, then retype, then it works.
"
"loading pics and comments take much longer, i.don't like it.
"
"serious bug dealing with notifications.
"
"opening app from a notification after its been running in the background for a while results in endless wait loop.
"
"never shuts down in the background and has no exit button.
"
"reinstalled to get the share link back bit the churning following a notification is still awful.
"
"still has issues with check-ins. :|
"
"after the latest update, i have not been able to post status updates on the first try, even with strong 4g data or wifi.
"
"generally speaking, the app seems much slower than previous versions.
"
"i see ""unable to establish a secure connection"" errors often.
"
"also it refreshes while i'm trying to read updates in my news feed and seems me to top of news feed page so i have to scroll and search for what i was reading.
"
"facebook crashes at least three times a day on my galaxy s2.
"
"i constantly clear data, but it still crashes...
"
"cant post photos to certain albums, cant delete comments & sometimes when i try uploading photos, they say 'error and photo cannot be uploaded' or somethin :/
"
"now it won't even load, just keeps saying error.
"
"doesn't update correctly, freezes a lot.
"
"needs fixed, doesn't show the comments or when i chose to look at pictures it doesn't load.
"
"will not load this sucks try again :(""""
"
"most recent didn't really show most recent feed, it still show top story.
"
"scrolling lag from time to time.
"
"slow loading after last update...
"
"rarely refreshes news feed on the first try.
"
"only shows up to 98 likes on a photo
"
"i wish we could save pics from this app
"
"does everything you would expect, still needs some work on the approvals for privacy confirmation process.
"
"but the major issue i have is some background task is grinding my phone to a halt.
"
"i cant delete comments anymore ever since i updated it ..
"
"pointless to even have on my phone anymore can't even use it like i should be able to..
"
"the new update has made it so i continually get network error or no internet connection which is just rubbish.
"
"after updating my system shuts down, i get errors and i can't post anything.
"
"will not refresh at all on my droid
"
"far too slow never loads , cant see anything , 'crap' any time i refresh it goes straight onto my actual internet !!!
"
"keeps crashing, forcing it to close.
"
"also you carnt view pictures
"
"yeah so this app ain't bad i use it more than the browser but that's gonna change, i was wondering why my phone memory was all gone so i decided to uninstall the updates now i got a load more memory, so until you can save this app to the memory card then i'm not using it.
"
"won't even let me log in!
"
"for some reason i cannot update my facebook status, leave comments, like things or perform any action on the mobile device that actually works.
"
"keeps losing conection, therefore uninstalling updates
"
"on my nexus seven tablet, nothing loads.
"
"i simply get a network error message.
"
"dear facebook,  please stop prompting me to add friends every friggin time i open your app.
"
"it worked perfectly fine for me until yesturday when i was on my laptop and changed my password, it logged me off my phone so i logged in with the new password and it kept saying error.
"
"can't remove comments anymore.
"
"once more will ask me this app to find friends from phone contacts list i will remove it i swear.
"
"i gave it 4 due to works and really gd but needs to be less i have it at 33.12 so slow then and i want it to get below then 20
"
"keeps playing up freezing lots of force close coming up come on fb sort it out i use it everyday and everyday i have problems
"
"been having issues with newsfeed refresh prior to that.
"
"now it tells me i have a single sign-on error, which even the great google search has not given me any clues on how to fix.
"
"it will sign in, but won't sync anything and won't post anything so it's basically useless for my purposes.
"
"so u have to ask me if i want to use my contacts to find friends multiple times a day.
"
"can't type two words without the thing crashing...
"
"the only complaint i have is that it has problems loading pics.
"
"it's slow to load (probably because it's searching my 'phone for stuff) .
"
"wants access to my 'photos, contacts, their birthdays and so much more!!!
"
"i cant share my location :/:=
"
"come on , facebook, every other app on my phone has functioning notifications, why can't you mange to get it right?
"
"wow my facebook use to be so slow it is so much faster and hasnt frozen yet.
"
"the recent update has blank pages now.
"
"i cant see any pictures on my app.
"
"the app runs extremely slow and sometimes not at all on the mobile network.
"
"pictures wont load and neither will contents.works fine threw wi-fi.
"
"the problem is it is constantly syncing and that drains battery  uninstall for an hour and you will notice huge increase in battery life
"
"it kicks me out once a day and drains my battery completely.
"
"my facebook is even slower than it already was before.
"
"it forced me to update which should be our choice.
"
"plz can i save pic, and iportent can i dalete comt from my pic and stetes....
"
"vryy sloww and too heavy..
"
"almst occupy my whole system memory...
"
"after auto correct got a word wrong i went back to change it, then the app froze.
"
"however, recently i have found myself waiting for an eternity to get anything to load properly if it even does.
"
"well i have top of the range phone,  fastest internet in the uk and this app fails constantly, how can a company this large not create a working application is beyond me,  slow, pictures and comments regularly fail to load, constant network errors and to top it off facebook fail to respond to these issues...
"
"when trying to watch a youtube video through fb, the option to watch through the youtube app is gone.
"
"you're automatically taken to the mobile youtube site where it says the video cannot be played.
"
"pretty frustrating, since it happens every single time i try to watch a posted youtube video.
"
"pics on the status update page dont load...
"
"this app is so slow.
"
"why don't i have the same options i do on the facebook website?
"
"why can't i remove posts from people on the app?
"
"why can i hide stories or pictures?
"
"and lastly it's very slow loading and sometimes doesn't load at all.
"
"the update said ""faster viewing of photos"" and now i can't see any pics at all, not even profile pics!

"
"signal is good but app says not.
"
"no access to pages.
"
"can't find them (used to find with friends ) or follow comments any longer.
"
"afterwards, photos are just gray squares and they don't always load when clicked on.
"
"now with the newest update, i was hoping the problems would be fixed, but instead the pictures won't load at all.
"
"all sharing options do not work
"

"
"half the time when i use facebook it says network error and won't load, when i have perfect 4g signal.
"
"i have to force close and try many different times for facebook to even load.
"
"i can't change my cover photo, i deleted my most recent cover photo and can't find a way to upload a new one on my android for my profile, there is no mini camera in the corner of the cover photo box and i can't change it if i go to my cover photo album either.

"why i cant post my status, it always says cant post at tis time????
"
"the major problem, i believe is you somehow created a memory leak.
"
"i say this because i noticed the more you use the app, the progressively worse it gets, until it doesnt even open or when it needs more memory for lets say a message and a notification at the same time, it crashes.

"
"wasting my time, lagging application .
"
"its really slow and takes a long time to load -_____-
"
"it takes up too much internal storage on my phone.
"
"they need to give me the option of moving it to my sd card, or they need to make the file smaller.

"i can't update my status i can't look and my group comments upload photos or comment on anything.
"
"takes up 28mb on my phone.
"
"i can't put updates on photos because the key pad blocks the comment area so i can't see what i've typed.
"
"the problem is that it either capitalizes every word or runs them all together.
"
"since it won't let me see the comment field while the keyboard is open  i can't fix it.

"downgrading my star score
"
"never had an issue on my droid charge.

"
"what is wrong with this app?

"on flipboard app everything is ok..

"
"before this update i could plz fix this i am getting very fed up with andriod
"
"easy banking experienc
"
"this update is ridiculous.
"
"and what's even more ridiculous is the fact that they haven't fixed it yet.
"
"you would think that after almost everyone gave a negitave review they would do something about it, but i guess they're too busy trying to get stock up.
"
"new update did not work on my phone..
"
"i honestly wish i can down grade to the update before this one ugh!
"
"you may feel this app as a crap if you are using it for the first time.

"
"iam one of th somali ethiopians live in srs city jigjiga like every one to live peace & prograsive
"
"that's on a full 4g connection or wifi.
"
"galaxy nexus 4g running jelly bean.
"
"i was skeptical thought that the update can't possibly be that bad .....
"
"worst version.
"
"i thought zuckerberg was a better programmer than this
"
"is it really that difficult to make and keep a fb application that works?
"
"it seems like for every step forward they take two backwards.
"
"will reevaluate once that's fixed as i hate using data when i have a hot spot right next to me.
"
"please review and help user.
"
"smile and let others smile
"
"this version of facebook is sucks.
"
"developers please work on problem soon......
"
"fb is my newspaper.without facebook no lifebook
"
"it was completely worthless, removed all updates and now it works fine again.
"
"this has been a problem since day one of using this crap app...
"
"if my laptop wasn't broke u would never use this.....
"
"it is easy to use this app than searching for this website.
"
"so i think it shoud be updated...
"
"otherwise its a good app..
"
"good thing i read the comments before updating ;))
"
"app sucks.
"
"then you'll get 5 stars
"
"awsome app meets my expictations
"
"i don't know what is happening with this application,but it's working extremely bad!
"
"why can't all facebook apps be in one application yet?
"
"no wonder everyone is leaving facebook.
"
"great apps
"
"very helpful in staying connected with social friends
"
"i swear when i first got my android phone several months ago, this fb app worked great,, but it seems with every update, it gets worse.
"
"i have uninstalled, ide rather use fb on my internet browser then this!
"
"no what i expected from an app with more thab a hundred million downloads..
"
"major bugs needs to be fixed..
"
"i wish i could uninstall this piece of crap
"
"this app is really starting to irritate me.
"
"this app is horrible
"
"can't live without this app
"
"it only works half the time...
"
"i love facebook.
"
"i love the updates, the fast loading and so on.
"
"i'm mainly addicted lol..
"
"the new update has rendered this app useless to me.
"
"new updates of fb app is not working correctly.
"
"kill someone to make the others put more effort into this huge companies interface please?
"
"google+ might gain some ground after this one...
"
"just updated & still no better than before, terrible app.
"
"we deserve a much better app than this surely!!
"
"this is rhe worst facebook ever, developers must be drug addics...
"
"new up grade just sucks plain an simple!!
"
"read the permissions!
"
"best social net work ever !
"
"when @ first your phn is new,apps run great then after each update everything sucks.
"
"i avoid certain updates like fb n youtube.
"
"i'd like to give you a big fat 0 for the latest update.
"
"2/5 update: it just keeps getting worse!
"
"you suck, app developers!!!
"
"i have had to uninstall it 2 times already.
"
"please try and fix it soon!
"
"day by day its bcoming the worst...
"
"testing my patience like anything worst uploading of the homepage itself n god knows abt d other things.......
"
"i have to agree with many here, that the quality fo fb for android has drastically dropped recently.
"
"i believe that if fb wants to put out a good product out there for us the end user, they need to expand in their android development for all current devices.
"
"i mean if they can develop consistent products, and this also applies to other social media they own, for apple then they should deliver the same quality for us!
"
"worst update ever like wtf.
"
"i dont think im invisible bc my kids see me walking around the house sooooo what the heck?!?!?
"
"i have seen many many many complaints on here about this same thing yet its still happening....
"
"i'm thinking it would be pretty darn cool of u to fix this...
"
"if i did my job this way, i'd be fired.
"
"every time you update you create more problems than you fix.
"
"this whole app is terrible.
"
"apples app is far better.
"
"maybe it's time to say bye bye facebook over this terrible app
"
"not at all impressed with these ""upgrades"" for smart phones.
"
"use it everyday with my games!
"
"how many complaints does there need to be before the problem gets fixed?
"
"fb randomly kicks the can again.
"
"need more modifications
"
"im on gs3 with full 4g signal.
"
"has made everything sooo simple, light and faster :d
"
"[edit] reduced the number of stars from 5 to 2.
"
"facebook mobile is really great social networking experience.
"
"apart from a few bugs it's great overall.
"
"gets worse with every update.
"
"get your act together facebook.
"
"i hope fb can fix this.
"
"i have read a lot of the reviews and comments here and it seems like everyone with the samsung galaxy phones r having similar problems.
"
"used to be great and work properly now its useless the mobile site is way faster so the app is pointless!!!
"
"apps with less devs and less funding can do a better job, facebook should be an industry standard of quality, but....
"
"using htc sense to upload.
"
"facebook app.
"
"im gonna chech it on my browser.
"
"total dissapointment!
"
"fix this app and i might download it again.
"
"awesome app be facebook
"
"droid htc incredible 2 is what i'm running my app on.
"
"absolutely awful!!
"
"with each ""update"" fb app just gets worse!!!
"
"i will be un-installing.
"
"if i could give it 0 stars i would   leaving my old review \/ since the recent ""upgrade""
"
"the entire app is now barely worth keeping.
"
"great app 5 stars :)
"
"it's not working on my phone at all right i'm not going golfing browser facebook comes up a lot better please fix it used to work like a week ago
"
"i always have to go directly to the web on my laptop to do anything  facebook is messing up :(
"
"even stopping the app and reopening doesn't work.
"
"facebook still can't make an app for android.
"
"much better uninstall the old app then re-install the new one than just update it by install over the old app
"
"every update makes the app worse...
"
"best app after updating it become more faster.
"
"this app is very cool i used to have it and it worked great :d
"
"i had deleted the app & then decided to get it again.
"
"all of the sudden the app does not work,no more!
"
"level up guys ..
"
"pure garbage.
"
"shouldn't of even bothered making this app....
"
"this app now can share things, chat express..
"
"facebook is a great app ansd it become better after each update
"
"i like it so people can contact each others
"
"running terrible.
"
"very good app i like it very much.
"
"ok till some extent
"
"it must be pretty bad when there are almost half as many 1 stars as 5 stars...
"
"and those 5 stars are probably really really old, back when everything worked fine....
"
"isn't that telling you something?
"
"i am going to uninstall until i read better reviews about upgrades.
"
"goodbye facebook app, hello facebook mobile website instead (for the times i actually even use facebook anymore which gets rarer)
"
"it gets worse and worse.
"
"i have this app because i need it for fast facebook access but i must say that i hate the app!
"
"update the app asap!
"
"this app sucks!!!!
"
"every time i update it it goes from ok to worse, then another update comes around and its a little better, then wham worse with the next update.
"
"the touch screen on my phone works fine in every other aspect.
"
"i've used this app on a galaxy s, s2 lte & now my note 2.
"
"this is becoming very annoying.
"
"please fix soon so i can rate this app with 5 stars.
"
"how do i tag photo of myself from others picture?
"
"i love facebook
"
"i heared that zuckerberg is a die hard apple fan!!
"
"maybe thats why!
"
"very poor app, he can hire better developers and spare time and money..
"
"jus use the browser..
"
"no matter how hard they try in the updates..
"
"try harder zuck.
"
"best app ever <3 especially for me .
"
"worthless 98% of the time.
"
"better off using your browser.
"
"it dont even work properly honested it plays up all the time
"
"i thought updates were supposed to be an improvement???
"
"you must kill it from a task manager or reboot.
"
"you'd think the tinkerers @ fb would get something right here but this app is just annoying.
"
"reduced to 1 star.
"
"great improvements
"
"i love facebook more than anything
"
"the second attempt usually works fine.
"
"it's pretty darn annoying and has forced me to use my computer instead, which of course means less fb.
"
"seriously,  everytime facebook updates, it's worse!
"
"getting very aggravated after latest update.
"
"iphone app is beastin this out the box!!
"
"since the updates, facebook for android has become, in my opinion, a much better app.
"
"it's easy to use, and you can now effectively see an 'offline news feed'!
"
"with simple-to-use features such as a 'pull down and release' mechanism to refresh the page, a swipe-out chat bar on the right and a swipe-out menu on the left, user friendliness is great!
"
"the app is quick to run, and doesn't consume battery life when running either!
"
"overall, a superbly updated app from the previous versions, very happy!
"
"i no longer am downloading updates for facebook they don't help or make it better
"
"very disappointed with the latest update.
"
"i updated facebook and it wont work now please fix it
"
"much better now, the latest update.
"
"also feels clunky to use.
"
"meaning android task manager needs to step in to kill.
"
"sent a report several times in the past, don't see this being fixed.
"
"so moving to alternatives.
"
"i thought the updates supposed to help.
"
"a lot of my friends are having trouble as well.
"
"is anyone else having this problem or have a solution?
"
"i've even uninstalled and reinstalled the app.
"
"app is beyond a joke, every update makes the app worse
"
"network is fine, it works for every other app i have. .
"
"i have had enough of your nagging and insinuations that i am a lonely man in need of more online companionship.
"
"never updates,  easier to use web browser, not happy!
"
"would recommend just using browser for now.
"
"google+ for mobile is so much better.
"
"because they listen to there users.
"
"i had this working on my phone until a few days ago.
"
"for god's sake, fix this otherwise i'll just not be using facebook!
"
"was so glad to have this app...
"
"im a facebook junkie but ever since the last update i've been screwed...
"
"so annoyed, i'm afraid to update anything now...
"
"i don't dance that dance!
"
"since new update its playing up!!!
"
"it takes longer time to update make it fast...!!!
"
"love this app..
"
"i really like itbest facebook app upgrade yet.
"
"especially since i hated the last one !!!
"
"i have verizon 4g with the droid razer max hd.
"
"the phone and network are extremely fast for every other app and the internet browser.
"
"the app itself works fine.
"
"fb update i hate the new update..
"
"i sure hope they figure this out fast.
"
"amaizing software it works fast i like this one
"
"everytime they updates it it get worse.
"
"doesnt work, crap!
"
"facebook, your app sucks!
"
"you suck donkey balls!!!
"
"i see the iphone application has a terrible following, at least you're consistent.
"
"nobody needs it to look pretty, how about getting it functional first.
"
"buy pretty well satisfied
"
"the team really needs to pick up their feet.
"
"it's almost better just to go to the website directly from my mobile web browser then it is to use the app.
"
"it doesn't matter if i have 3g, 4g or wifi!
"
"feel great to have it!
"
"instead of faffing around adding things that aren't needed sort all the other issues out.
"
"why do you have to complicate things all the time.
"
"very very bad user experience.
"
"dead useless since latest update.
"
"don't want or need what they've added.
"
"the app was working fine, until two or three updates ago.
"
"why is there a rating section if they don't even look at it and fix the problems?
"
"bad performance
"
"dear facebook devs, could you please drop your iphones for a while and take care of android platform!
"
"r u guys ever gonna fix all the problems with this app or what???
"
"finally native app
"
"app sucks any more..
"
"it will run great then u add a upgrade and then it runs like crap
"
"its cool this app performing view equal to pc.
"
"the way facebook app and mobile site seems to be decreasing in workmanship, facebook owners must not care about facebook users.
"
"it's like they are joking around.
"
"i remember when the app did work.
"
"what happened facebook?
"
"if i go to the same status but opening directly from my timeline, the comment posts ok.
"
"proper annoying!
"
"updates are for improving!
"
"over 1 million one star reviews - the worst in the market (& one of the most invasive) & still going downhill.
"
"i do not trust this app.
"
"this app's only plus is that it gives you a *glimpse* of your facebook feed, at best.
"
"other than that, the app fails on delivering any sort of reliable functionality.
"
"completely unacceptable from such a large company such as facebook.
"
"still a bit buggy at times
"
"simply most useful app around!
"
"with every update they seem to solve bugs there's always a new issue
"
"i want a low maintenance app.
"
"app sucks
"
"need some improvement
"
"i love this app and use it every day
"
"this app sucks for android.
"
"when i use it on my iphone , its near instant.
"
"i expected something better.
"
"i have an ipad and it is as instant as my iphone.
"
"im giving you a chance and so far, you failed .
"
"are we ever going to get an update where things are going great for longer than several weeks?
"
"each upgrade gets worse.
"
"i just use mobile web based now.
"
"for the love of god fb.
"
"it worked ok for me until i got the latest update.
"
"seems they took a buggy app and introduced even more bugs.
"
"if it isnt fixed soon im uninstalling.
"
"un-install and the phone runs perfectly!
"
"its very fast with voice messages
"
"as convenient as it is to have this on my phone, it's just as annoying.
"
"unuseable its nonfunctioning
"
"facebook fans download it now!!!!!!!!!!
"
"i'm on 4g and wi-fi, no excuses...
"
"the most recent update sucks.
"
"i have to uninstall and reinstall every 2 days.
"
"after years of development the app is still full of bugs.
"
"instead of adding more features why do you try and get the basic features functional first.
"
"no, facebook, no. stop asking me.
"
"my granny is faster than rubbish !!!
"
"it is a useless junk application!
"
"did u know updating means???
"
"i gave 1 star coz i took it for free, but it is better to be uninstalled.
"
"recent updates have made this app completely useless.
"
"an app from a publicly traded company should perform much much better.
"
"when this app was, you know, simple, it was great.
"
"i'm deleting it from my phone.
"
"g+ and twitter from now on i guess.
"
"always stop for no reason an when i try to report it will not let me y is that
"
"the android version of the facebook app is terrible!
"
"samsung charge.

"all the time, hate that!!!
"
"sucks tried getting rid of if it horrible app
"
"i think this is why words with friends won't work anymore either since it ties into facebook friends.
"
"for such a high quality site, your app is very poor quality.
"
"now if i plan to write a long-ish post, i type it in my notepad app, and cut&paste it into facecbook.
"
"this is very annoying, please fix this (i'm using s3, don't know if the bug is phone-specific).
"
"otherwise i'd give it 5 stars.
"
"not critical, but would be handy.
"
"not only is this annoying but it is very frustrating when i'm trying to talk to my husband who is deployed in afghanistan.
"
"facebook is our main source of communication when he gets some (not often) time to talk.
"
"it becomes worse than previously
"
"this app is the worst, i ever seen on a samsung phone.
"
"it's not the best app for facebook.
"
"their mobile site loads better.
"
"i don't know if it's just because i have an older phone, or if it's their app, but either way, the other social media apps work better.
"
"the newest update sucks...
"
"app fails all the time
"
"there are way too many problems with this app for me to recommend anyone to install one there device.
"
"needs to improve, otherwise 5star app
"
"this app sucks bad.
"
"i use the internet instead most of the time.
"
"its so irritating i don't even like to use it like i used to.
"
"5 stars if these issues are resolved!
"
"its the best in convenece but needs an update
"
"fuckin sucks...
"
"i have to constantly remind me of that
"
"if i didn't move across country i would delete this app...
"
"it's been like this for 3 updates now seriously this is getting old.
"
"if i knew more people with google + i would switch.
"
"this deserved rating in negative if possible
"
"you guys really need to get it together for fb mobile.
"
"it keeps getting worse.
"
"some of the screw ups that i can even remember, there's so many...
"
"but need improvement
"
"the older version of this app is much better. :(
"
"more than a month now without the app.
"
"will not update or install.
"
"despite having full lte signal.
"
"every time i see there's an update for facebook i just know there's a chance of decreased quality in the app but this last one was especially horrible.
"
"they really screwed the pooch on this app.
"
"getting worse each day after last update.
"
"i have to restart app often.
"
"this app is now total and utter piece of crap.
"
"verry good software
"
"i hate this app...
"
"i don't uderstand why you people not doing anything.
"
"makes me sad.
"
"please fix this then dont do anymore updates!!!!
"
"please update it very soon earlier update was much much faster than the latest update.
"
"facebook is da best
"
"if you want your memory taken over by just one app then this is for you.
"
"soon the only operating app is going to be just this.
"
"i like this app very much but it could use chat
"
"becoming worse after every update.
"
"i uninstalled and now i use messenger and opera browser.
"
"why is messenger getting better and facebook becoming worse?
"
"suck after update it...
"
"if you are looking at updating this app i sincerely hope you don't.
"
"worst app update ever.
"
"used to have a 5 star rating from me
"
"fb should pay attentions for that
"
"awsum app...?
"
"dont really like using facebook mobile but at least its reliable.
"
"always used for higher level mobiles.
"
"i have the samsung galaxy exhilerate, which is a very fast phone so i know its not because of that, i'm also running jelly bean.
"
"very nice one lool
"
"is completely a crap.
"
"due seems like nobody at facebook tests properly for the real world.
"
"its almost like they assume facebook is the only app.
"
"i've not exploited google's yet, but facebook is starting to push us users that way.
"
"wake up facebook, start developing apps like grownups.
"
"hassling out crap app updates is going to be your demise if you don't get your act together.
"
"shuts off some times but good
"
"the app is a streaming pile of crap.
"
"always has been, and i don't expect better in the future.
"
"very poor app
"
"fb is always a bigest addiction to all nd me 2...
"
"updates always suck -.-""
"
"never using fb on phone again.
"
"gets worse with every update...
"
"becoming useless...
"
"so i'm rating it 1 because it is the only possible rating i could give
"
"really poor, buggy app.
"
"using the website is a lot quicker and i can actually post things.
"
"samsung stratosphere the app won't even work.
"
"your app sucks, schmuckerberg.
"
"i have a motorola electrify and facebook will not allow any facebook apps to function on my phone..
"
"so i'm paying the price for these electronic moguls to feed their fued..
"
"what wrong with facebook app on android since there was nothing wrong with ios facebook app in my iphone before this..
"
"i am always going toy browser to reply back, too much waste of time..
"
"app deleted.
"
"so stop tampering with something that worked perfectly well
"
"after the update it's not working any more.
"
"i wan't update it.
"
"no need to comment........
"
"seriously, what happened dude?
"
"not thrilled with the new version.
"
"have you actually seen the facebook appstore app please try to put the android app up to that standard .........
"
"getting annoyed with the new update
"
"previous updates were a lot better!
"
"much much easier to use facebook through the browser now :(
"
"galaxy siii user!
"
"open facebook faster and photos also
"
"i have samsung s2 n my friend who has s3 has the same issue.
"
"is fb boycutting samsung phones?!
"
"i realized most samsung users have problems on this app.
"
"this app needs to be a lot more vanilla instead of jam-packed with bloatware.
"
"just plain terrible
"
"it used to be better before i allowed the update.
"
"worthless to download
"
"i like the old one way better.
"
"horrible app!!
"
"i rarely leave bads reviews, but this app has earned it.
"
"this fb app for android stinks!
"
"many more cons than pros.
"
"i like this application.
"
"but i want my update via samsung.
"
"facebook is the best red social of the world
"
"installed and it works fine

"please fix this then dont do anymore updates!!!!
"
"it acts up too much if they fixed it i would rate it 5 stars
"
"easy facebook access

"did not have this problem until last couple updates.
"
"my connection is okay.
"
"time to update!
"
"sick of pls fix it!!!!
"
"its sad when the browser works better than the app.
"
"clearly, it has a flaw along those lines.
"
"makes me not like my phone sometimes but it's clearly the app.
"
"actual improvements would be nice.
"
"it sucks but i've seen worse.
"
"facebook has a lot of work to do though and they better do it asap.
"
"removed it and using just browser
"
"then i'll give 5 star...
"
"i don't like how every time i go on the app.
"
"the non-app version doesn't have all the crap in the stream.
"
"i get social, but where is my option to opt out.
"
"best facebook app for chat
"
"i had to uninstall your app then reinstall it by updating to get it to work.
"
"please your updating screws it up.

"so from now on i will not allow automatic updating.
"
"i will manually update the app myself.
"
"still no stars over one, for rating!

"
"my facebook was working good in till my update.
"
"amazing app love it <3
"
"lots of errors problems!
"
"it hardly ever works, and i'd love to see it fixed.
"
"i am sooo in agreement with paul rowland!
"
"i can't tell u how upsetting it is to see an app that has over 100,000,000 users
"
"have uninstalled multiple times and updated, but nothing helps.
"
"it isn't compatible with rootbox rom on android 4.2 on the market, but i searched the web and it installed just fine
"
"is it that hard being a massive coporation to listen to your users and make an app that f*cking works!
"
"fb forever
"
"no, i don't want to find new friends
"
"why isn't this feature working properly?
"
"pretty annoying.
"
"the browser works better than the app....
"
"i uninstalled this app
"
"pls fix for motorola xt-502.
"
"this app is not so bad as people's reviews say ...
"
"i have not updated it since a very old version b/c of the reviews but when i did i liked it its ok a lot faster than old version not so much lags for my way of using
"
"just removed update and back to build in version (old 1 year i think) and now every thing is smooth.
"
"so 0 stars for new update
"
"i realize this is a free app but how difficult is it to make it work.
"
"friendcaster is free too and that's what i'm using from now on.
"
"your app sucks.
"
"simply ridiculous.
"
"really bad app.
"
"getting worse.
"
"completely foolish and uninituative app...
"

"i dont use facebook therfore i dont want it.
"
"very poor app!
"
"basically useless!
"
"i don't really like using it.
"
"the app makes me think facebook is even more overrated.
"
"it should've never gone public.
"
"each update gets worse and worse, even if i uninstall and then reinstall.
"
"please fix this asap, starting to get really annoying.
"
"can not get on facebook where is some help.
"
"sister loves it
"
"tired of all the errors!
"
"my mobile is low range one it troubleing to this app
"
"i have installed and unistalled for many times but still having the same problem..
"
"keep it up, inspite of encountering major or minor bugs i consider you as a champion of social network
"
"facebook is worth so much money, but cannot even make an app that works.
"
"samsung galaxy iii
"
"itd be great if youd fix this.
"
"i recently bought a samsung galaxy tab 10 inch, and i also have had the 7 inch galaxy tab.
"
"the facebook app would work great on the 7 inch, but since the latest update, it has not been working properly.
"
"fix these issues, and give us another, better update!
"
"on top of all of that, i can't even give a review for the facebook app.
"
"lol it is as if you know you're going to get a negative review, so you block those reviews from posting.
"
"i just decided to go with the browser instead.
"
"ittss okayyy !
"
"carolene sears loves her facebook
"
"still could use polishing but very updated for android
"
"reception, in general, has never been great either.
"
"any suggestions as to what i might try?
"
"the constant 'upgrades' seem to be mostly backward motions and make it more difficult rather than easier or better.
"
"the last update screwed it up on my phone!
"
"this update seriously sucks.
"
"when i know  i got an internet connection.
"
"working better than the previous version but not so fast or cool.
"
"fb app hasnt been the same in a long time, i see im not the only 1 having this problem.
"
"after the last update i'm about ready for facebook to buy me a new phone because i'm going to throw mine against a wall.
"
"its so annoying, you're better of just using the internet over this stupid app!
"
"if you had a competitor, i would take all 400+ of my multi-national friends away with me.
"
"this app is fucked up.
"
"indeed an awesome app!
"
"faster too but only wid a 3g connection!
"
"thank you developers!
"
"the worst facebook app i have ever used.
"
"when i know for a fact that my network is available....
"
"this app just keeps getting worse..

"had to uninstall and reinstall app a few times recently.
"
"i've looked around, but can't find it.
"
"has this moved, or is it no longer available?
"
"it does not matter if it's a free service or not.
"
"you really don't care about us as the consumer.
"
"i personally have reported issues and my issues match alot of other people's.
"
"so that to me shows you obviously dont care, otherwise the issues would have been corrected by now.

"Take forever to upload ....
"
"Painfully slow when it does decide to work.
"
"I continually experience freezing, black screens, my phone gets locked up...
"
"Nice update but Can't upload pics from Samsung galaxy note 2.
"
"Is anyone else having problems seeing pictures on your wall or news feed? Non of them load.
"
"I like the upgrade to it but HATE the fact that you cant erase your comments or others anymore thru phone.
"
"I really liked that I could delete comments by swiping left to right.
"
"Been getting a black screen lately...
"
"Also freezes a lot and keeps saying network error.
"
"Will not load, and even when it does it force closes and freezes my phone, I uninstalled it!!!
"
"It's only been happening recently, but none of the images appear and I get that 'cannot retrieve at this time' message.
"
"it stops working after my android os is upgraded....
"
"You took away the ability to choose albums, if a pic has more than 2 or 3 words in the description you can't read it anymore due to the popup feature.

"
"1) Ability to unfollow a post.
"
"For example, when someone comments on a post, FB will blink blue the LED on the phone, and give a notification at the website. If I clear the notification at the website, the LED will still blink.
"
"No comments and likes are refreshing.
"
"Have to click to comment to see the comments and likes.
"
"Since ive put the update in its not posting status's
"
"Cant view anythin!!
"
"It's not letting me post my status...
"
"Try to make a faster and lite version which consumes less battery, RAM and cpu !!!!
"
"When will you fix tired of it no connection tion and freezes all the time stops responding
"
"My only complaint right now would be an issue that I noticed time ago but never took the time to provide my feedback.
"
"Always says no internet connection wen i have full service.
"
"I have to clear cache/data and logoff and login to update news feed.
"
"My qwerty has glitches when typing comments/posts.
"
"I was so pleased with the update about a month ago until it started freezing and losing network connection!
"
"Can't post from phone.
"
"You cant delete posts either ???
"
"when I ""like"" someone's picture or status, it won't let me like it, I have to press several times to be able to ""like"" something.
"
"It almost never loads properly, usually losses the network connection, and worst of all, it has somehow managed to screw up the data connections for my other programs.
"
"Network error?...
"
"Hate the fact I can't swipe and delete comments please fix this
"
"It won't let us change our cover photo for a new pic.

"It wont load photos, profiles, comments.
"
"It is laggy, even on a Nexus 4.
"
"Neither my own nor posts to other's status work any more.
"
"It is just too easy to post errors from a phone.

"
"Can't post statuses.

"
"Slow to respond.
"
"crashes an takes ages to update

"It was working great now it force closes every time I try to open it!!!!!
"
"I look at a loading screen more than anything else.
"
"The amount of likes somebody gets on a status update as I scroll down my news feed aren't up to date.
"
"Slow, problems with slow laggy updates and failure to view photos,at times.
"
"I can't post comments or photos And photos doesn't load.
"
"Especially posting picture.
"
"Constant crashing.
"
"Network connection issues ....
"
"Network Error?
"
"slow but nice options :-):-):-):-):-)
"
"The news feed shown is old...
"
"cant even like an album from the news feed...
"
"Facebook forces all the things you hate and disabled on the PC to reappear in this still-flaky app.
"
"The most famous Facebook stupidity of non-editable posts becomes glaringly obvious when using a touch-screen.
"
"Network errors, painfully slow loading on a 4G connection.
"
"Also I can't delete unwanted comments off of my timeline like before.
"
"Keeps crashing, ughhh come out with something that works for the love of God!
"
"Hate how long it takes to load, and then get network errors when I am connected to my wifi...
"
"Plus it's extremely slow to load new feeds.
"
"And also relised there was a lot missing on the app like can't delete comments you make or other people make on your things and you can't edit comments etc.
"
"Cant copy abd paste from posts.
"
"Cant delete pists on my phone.
"
"I can not post a status update or share anything!
"
"And when will the black screen when viewing images be fixed?
"

"
"New notifications are not updated immediately..
"
"Uninstsllimg updates and rootuninstalling doubled battery life overnight.
"
"For the DROID X Freezes and force closes all the time!

"News feed is jacked up, won't stay current.
"
"Using my cnm tablet, its terrible it always force closes as always laggy.
"
"No longer receive pokes in notifications
"
"Since last update I haven't been able to see any pictures unless I click on them or go to the browser and its slow.
"
"This is bullshit, the homepage wont even load it just say connection error.
"
"Unable to download it showing error no 497 any solution
"
"Taken off another star as I can't change my cover photo anymore.
"
"And when I ""like"" a status it doesn't save it.
"
"Although my settings are set to new stories first, they are never in the correct time order until I go into settings and click on new stories first again
"
"Overall, its a good app, but i have found that it keeps force closing, or just black screens ):
"
"Noy working this app in my device, why?
"
"Everything takes ages to update and recent stories list is all over the place.
"
"Will Not load or allow me to do anything on it please fix
"
"Takes forever to load the contents even with WiFi connection.
"

"Really is annoying, coz i cant post whats on my mind at the time!!
"
"No network connection and error loading story is driving me nuts that I nearly killed ant with my head while banging my head on the table.
"
"Can't quit facebook!
"
"Why dose this app never tell me when someone messages me?
"
"It doesnt connect sometimes and is slow fix it
"
"The option to swipe and delete comments.
"
"Back to freezing up, force close, error posting comments, numerous other problems.
"
"You have to go in and out constantly to try to post.
"
"TOO MANY ERROR LOADING!!!
"
"Status's dissapearing & doesnt refresh properly.
"
"Always resets to top stories even if most recent is selected
"
"Wats wrong i am not able to post any comment it just gives me erorr
"
"Wont share pictures either.
"
"And also, since last update it appears this is chewing thru my data.
"
"My pictures won't load on my newsfeed and its making me irritated
"
"I wish the new update had the option to save on my large SD card!!
"
"So frustrating, pictures don't show up at all keep having to uninstall and reinstall in order to get it to work.
"
"Takes forever to load, says no network connection all the time.
"
"In order to get the latest updates on the timeline I will need to actually close and restart the app.
"
"Firstly, at least once a day when I am trying to refresh my news feed it will say 'network error'.
"
"Doesn't show comments or likes on statuses, wallposts, etc.
"
"it's always clicks me out says there is an error..
"
"Stops working and shuts down all the time.
"
"low speed,no pic download.
"
"Since last update I keep getting network error and can't update my status.
"
"Contact Sync is no longer and option and unable to check page messages
"
"The update is always crashing and whenever im in the middle of my chat it lags all the time... :(
"
"But Not able to download images
"
"Links don't go to app just to browser
"
"Terrible, can't upload photos anymore or update my status.
"
"I hate that you can no longer delete a comment you make on someone's post, or on your own for that matter.
"
"I and the one who i sent this code wants to see picture not number.
"
"Can't find camera icon to change my cover photo.
"
"It doesn't work on Desire
"
"Cant view an entire Photo.
"
"Always force close.
"
"Not to mention the fact that it force closes half the time, videos take too long to upload and have yet to add the edit comment tool as in the mobile site.
"
"Should implement a way my videos can be seen that are in my album
"
"i want to exclude some folder to display in select picture page.
"
"Facebook worked fine on my phone till this last update now I cant use it at all on my phone.
"
"As a result, fb stop running many many times.
"
"not like the website.
"
"Update sucks.
"
"please fix or gonna stop using.
"
"Inconsistent implementation.
"
"This app sucks now
"
"please fix these problems its soooo fustrating :/
"
"I can just read n like others though.
"
"Very annoying, I always end up using the mobile app.
"
"I'm done this app sucks!
"
"It may be faster but it doesn't always work.
"
"My phone is HTC Explorer.
"
"Sucks ever since the update!
"
"The last update of facebook has some guds and many bads  at time worst.
"
"My friends haven't upgraded theirs n they can do it.
"
"Ugh this sucks ..
"
"Ugh wish I didnt upgrade.
"
"I am hating this app lately.
"
"Finger licking good
"
"Uninstalled and reinstalled!
"
"Facebook went to hell.
"
"It is the best app for facebook users...
"
"ya it has some bad things but it doesn't effect on its rating...
"
"It provides 80% of the functionality of the normal web-site.
"
"Assuming I just didn't miss the selection in the app, it needs the following functionality:
"
"GMail will stop blinking on the phone if I clear the email queue at their website.
"
"Overall, a poorly done app.
"
"How do you continue to make this app worse with every release?
"
"This is the best facebook ever on any platform....
"
"This is the most unreliable app on my phone.
"
"It just gets worse with every update.
"
"They need to put some serious work into this
"
"this app is completely horrible.
"
"If theres nothin wrong then dont bother updating it.
"
"Yes I have uninstalled/reinstalled twice now.
"
"Way below what I would expect from facebook.
"
"Previous update worked perfect, this one is the opposite.
"
"Most of the time I just use the internet on my phone.
"
"The developers should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a disaster!
"
"does anyone actually work at facebook?!?
"
"It feels like there's something missing..
"
"I think with a bit of polishing, it could become better, but it is still no where near as polished as iOS.
"
"Soooo inconvenient & annoying!
"
"Quicker browser fb directly on internet app.
"
"Uninstalled then reinstalled but still can't :(
"
"So frustrating please sort it out!!!!
"
"It's utter bollocks.
"
"Wish I hadn't done the update
"
"I pretty much liked the upgrade i liked the way they changed the comments and notifications way easier.
"
"How do I search for page's?
"
"Its quicker to access the mobile site than use this app.
"
"IT WASNT BROKE...
"
"Why is it not yet repaired after so many users complained? !?!?!?
"
"I like an older version FIX IT
"
"One day works like its supposed to...
"
"Wake up devs you fail...
"
"Updates from the archives?
"
"Are we on Candid Camera?
"
"earlier version was way better than this...
"
"Sticking to the browser mobile site.
"
"Can do all of the same stuff on it anyway.
"
"is this some sort of bussines politics?
"
"Being cheap on the servers perhaps.
"
"I love using facebook & it's now easier to load a status.
"
"I wouldn't mind if it was working properly......
"
"Every time this stupid app  trys to update it gets worse and worse.
"
"yet you are unable to get a simple phone app to work?!?
"
"From; Your angriest consumer
"
"For some reason everything is sudently playing up so had to resault in using the mobile site.
"
"a lot of pipol using this app y not care to fix all the bugs!!!
"
"I'm getting ones I have looked at 2 days previously.
"
"Wish I could revert back to last version!!!!!!
"
"This upgrade sucks..
"
"If it's not broke don't try to fix it!
"
"I hate this update!
"
"That is a sign of an app that needs to go away.
"
"Uninstalled updates to see if that would fix it.
"
"The new format just rocks.
"
"Uninstalled and reinstalled twice.
"
"Didn't help.
"
"I use it ALL the time & I would love to update it on my LG OptimisZip.
"
"I expect more from a ""top developer""!!!!!
"
"Wtf worst update ever.
"
"Getting better all the time.
"
"It was fine before the update fix it now please!
"
"Starting to see the benefits, very nice.
"
"Loading in Chrome browser is a lot faster.
"
"Nice app
"
"Some nice new animations and features are are there, it just needs to be able to do simple tasks.
"
"Should have not updated from previous app.
"
"update is all the problems starting....
"
"this new update is the worst!
"
"this doesn't even deserve 1 star....
"
"Loving the improvements...
"
"WORST APP.
"
"I've been waiting way too long 4 them to fix the bugs, pathetic really
"
"Since getting this update.
"
"I can't believe y'all haven't produced a new update to replace the POS version y'all have on Market for Android...
"
"Do you honestly believe we'll all just sit around waiting for unicorns to come fart some magical unicorn butt glitter into the air then poof FB will FINALLY work properly???
"
"I'v tried leaving it for 10/15 mins but it doesn't make a difference.
"
"Please sort this out Facebook as everything else on the app is great but at the moment this issue ruins it for me.
"
"This app needs totally rewrite.
"
"Before the update it worked fine.
"
"ill use my browers..
"
"Please fix this problem for HTC one x, since my note2 don have this problem
"
"The app works a lot better on my new phone. (it has tons of space on it!)
"
"Ill stick to just using the internet browser for facebook!!
"
"Definitely one of the worst, if not the worst app that I've ever used...!
"
"lots of problems in this app..
"
"Please fix, then stop updating it.
"
"Not happy guys....
"
"Talk to your friends
"
"The browser version is more up to date.
"
"This app is good n useful
"
"Wonder  in the world
"
"It has many more options, lets you save pictures, has themes and offers a much better overall experience.
"
"Goodbye Facebook for Android,  I'd rather put up with the inconvenience of using my browser for Facebook from now on rather than having to view the rubbish you now display.
"
"Nice app to chat with everyone
"
"the latest update sucks:(
"
"Getting worse everyday
"
"Luv all da new updates much easier 2 use.
"
"I really think more time and effort could be invested in making this app functional.
"
"This latest update ruined facebook for android.
"
"Why take one step forward and then three steps back?
"
"Use the mobile site.
"
"2 stars for the pic quality.
"
"Absolute crap now after the update plz fix
"
"Another garbage update.
"
"Consensus is right on fb updates are getting worse much worse rather than better.
"
"im getting even more issues with this garbage app facebook devs!
"
"fix this crap i now run jelly bean on my sgs2 so i shouldn't have one error!
"
"This app works awesome on a smartphone
"
"Zero star Instead..
"
"Shame such a poor quality app is released from such a big name time and again.
"
"Facebook needs to stop focussing on ways to line their pockets (sponsoring?), and how to keep their users happy.
"
"Or else like the way of myspace they will fail.
"
"The list goes on.
"
"I'm forced to use the internet and not the app on my phone.
"
"Pretty much impossible to use.
"
"This app completly sucks..
"
"No matter how many updates  are put out, Facebook mobile is still the glitchiest app on my phone.
"
"Its really all u want in a app.
"
"Still soul sucking
"
"Not worth the upgrade.
"
"The plus side is that we can now look at pics without having to click them.
"
"Also the pics pop up immediately now, which is awesome!
"
"Running great now after the mid-Dec update!
"
"Bunch of crap!
"
"Piece of garbage.
"
"My mom won't get off the phone to pay attention to me
"
"This download needs to b tweaked more still having problems with this app!
"
"This app is perfect other than that!!
"
"That's annoying as hell!
"
"Updated facebook on my toshiba tablet and now it will not work AT ALL!!
"
"Its only good if you want to check other posts.
"
"Its complete and utter crap Please upgrade or I will uninstall!
"
"Why is it with every upgrade the facebook app gets worse?
"
"fix this and overall its a nice 1
"
"For now I give it 3 stars when added I will give you back the other 2 stars Deserved.
"
"But iys pretty good
"
"The app started to get better this past fall but now is back to doing the opposite.
"
"I'm using a Motorola RAZR 4g phone.
"
"Garbage app ignorant creators!!
"
"This app is great to use.
"
"Fix whatever bug is please~~~~~~~~~~~~
"
"Even tho I have 2000 friends, it should still load.
"
"Nice updates.
"
"Wish I never updated.
"
"This app is awful and i can't believe anyone would develop something so crappy.
"
"Galaxy Note II on Jellybean..
"
"The last update is terrible.
"
"Yeah, all these newer updates suck.
"
"I mean, I'm happy to have fb on my phone regardless, but it never worked this crappy is all I'm trying to get at.
"
"who doesn't love Facebook
"
"I'll just use the web browser from now on.
"
"It's an app for your phone.
"
"And if its an issue then get rid of your phone.
"
"But it will get better with time.
"
"Bout done with facebook apps..

"
"You guys suck at this.
"
"If you have a version that's working on your phone stick with it.
"
"Sucks I HATE THE NEW UPDATE.
"
"My mobilw browser is 100 times faster.
"
"Facebook needs to make this more simple rather load it up with wasted features.
"
"Hope this gets sorted soon!
"
"With each new update Facebook is getting worse and worse.
"
"u charge to talk to Mr vain
"
"Since your last two updates you have made fb on my phone useless thanks.
"
"How about beta testing the next update before releasing it.
"
"Subpar actions for such a large company.
"
"Updated for bugs constantly.
"
"Fire the devs because apparently they lack the knowledge to make a good product.
"
"I've always had good luck with the app, but not anymore!
"
"Is intuitive, functional and stable.
"
"And the images open instantly!
"
"Aft repeatedly update..

"
"I update every time only in hopes one finally works and puts me back to the old version but I say never update if you havent yet.
"
"Works fine just like it says

"Not reinstalling again until somethings fixed!
"
"This app SUCKS!

"You update the app and make it worse.
"
"This is excellent my friend
"
"Before the last updated is better than the last one.
"
"Pretty please a better update faster as possible.

"I am getting sick and tired of the app often not refreshing.
"
"Improvement builds perfection.
"
"And these guys are doing a great job.
"
"I find myself accessing the regular site often to do things that should be simple to do here.
"
"It saves battery and data.
"
"other apps run faster when FB isnt always active.
"
"Not on the app, or my phones web brownser.
"
"This app STILL f***ing sucks.
"
"Can you get a version that just plain works??

"I uninstalled and reinstalled twice with the same results.
"
"Best baaghi balagan
"
"Awesome app .
"
"Its really a great application for android.
"
"Much better than precious versions
"
"After the first time I tell the app that I do not want to import my contacts I would prefer it not ask every freaking time I open the app up, its ef'in retarded.
"
"I have always loved this app
"
"Everyone is complaining about so FIX IT ALREADY because your new update didn't f***in do it!
"
"I end up using my browser anyway most of the time.
"
"Working Quite nice after new updates.
"
"Fix are looking real nice.
"
"I have to use friend caster.
"
"Minus three stars.
"
"New update seems to b faster.
"
"Just stop this app if u can't make anything sensible.
"
"This is absolutely insane.
"
"Saves maybe half of your likes.
"
"Why can't u guys get it together if u Wana compete w apple you really need to do a better job seriously they're version is 100 times better wonder if we all delete it would you make it better then hmmm
"
"A lot of updates and never one good.
"
"They are consistently bad.
"
"Fix it or i hv to use fb from my phones browser.
"
"you ruined it with the last update smh
"
"Very easy way to check facebook on the go.
"
"Since I upgraded the new upgrade on fb there's some things I realize I can't do anymore.
"
"old version was better
"
"Typical of everything Facebook really.
"
"Its okay if you like facebook
"
"I love staying connecting with the facebook app
"
"Please do some fast,light and reliable application
"
"Withdraw it and let people use a working solution - the previous version.
"
"Bring back previous version.
"
"Ever since the update this app is horrible.
"
"when just before the update it worked fine.
"
"The share feature is good!
"
"Facebook emplyes get payed for nothing, couse that's what they do.
"
"The worst since update!
"
"This is a bunch of BS!
"
"This version is very smooth
"
"Concentrate on speed because speed matters.
"
"Old version worked better but still EXTREMELY disappointed and annoyed.
"
"It is much more faster to brows with default browser
"
"Overall,  this application has a lot of problems due to straying from the working formula.
"
"Poorest app , I ever operate, new update is not good, recommend not to download, I going to uninstall that, bakwas app.
"
"Lame facebook, lame.
"
"Hopefully the native app update comes soon.
"
"It works on my phone (HTC wildfire s) with troubles
"
"And web isnt working either.
"
"At least it didn't push them into my google contacts this time.
"
"I didn't like new facebook .....
"
"this app needs improvement ASAP.
"
"Doesnt deserve any star.
"
"Its been like this for about a month now and still no fix.
"
"Ok but updates should be improved
"
"I won't install this again.
"
"I recommend using this app never gives me problems..
"
"getting really frustrated bout to delete fix soon please :-)
"
"So much bugs and features missing compared to the mobile version.
"
"I absolutely hate this app.

"
"Theres some little bit bugs that need to fix but overall great app for me :)
"
"this update is great as it's faster than the past and the interface is changed.
"
"This live updating is awful!
"
"So now i'm downgrading this app from 4 stars to 2 stars.
"
"Come on with these crappy updates.
"
"But recently its been garbage very disappointed
"
"like it soo much <3 :)
"
"I have tried both apps on my Smartfren Andro, cheap Android with 1 Ghz processor.
"
"Facebook official app is more fast when we got notification, because this app use push.
"
"tell me how that makes sense?
"
"it didn't say that on my old phone (the LG Esteem) please fix 3 stars till fixed
"
"Now come on I'm on high speed virgin wireless on a Nexus 10.
"
"Rating refers to latest update.
"
"Fix, please for Galaxy Note 1.
"
"Will use full internet site till then.
"
"You would think the FB app should be one of the best contributing apps in the Play Store.....
"
"This is an awesome app.
"
"no longer i need to use the regular Internet;)
"
"I think there may be a bug or glitch in the last update.
"
"The app basically keeps you connected and updated about your family and friends via Facebook.
"
"You can do watever you like..
"
"I gave u a bad review previously...
"
"Excellnt application
"
"I love the new pop-up post viewer and how the new posts on the feed are moved to the top rather than automatically updating the entire window.
"
"More efficient and faster
"
"It works so good on my tablet really happy!!!!!!!
"
"Every time there is an update the app just goes further down hill.
"
"Looking forward to more cool updates. :)
"
"Its very good fr facebook users
"
"for one of the top 5 apps downloaded I'm disappointed over and over again.
"
"This ap sucks.
"
"totally frustrating.
"
"Used to love this app.
"
"Much better since update
"
"This update confessed me to rate it with 5 stars..
"
"Hell of an app...
"
"freaking its so glitchy!!
"
"The old glitches are just being replaced by new glitches!
"
"With every update there seems to be less things available to do on the phone.
"
"Why change what was working fine?
"
"Good App Until It's Updated !
"
"May I know what's wrong with Facebook recently?!
"
"I only really use the app for a quick way to upload pics but I like it fairly well
"
"Communication king
"
"Best app on google play...
"
"This is the fourth time I install this app after long time.
"
"If not because all my contacts are there I would not use the app.
"
"Major Improvement
"
"used to work flawlesly until the recent update which kinda busted the app...
"
"Liked it better before
"
"Not sure what else to do besides using my laptop.
"
"Worked prior to update.
"
"Worse then the real facebook.
"
"Worked great for two days.
"
"This update is awesome
"
"Wonderful app wonderful thngs.
"
"I am a regular fb user bt this version makes me think should I use fb this poorly?
"
"Seems like every update is worse and worse.
"
"I wish they would juat fix this app right and then quit messing with it.
"
"Total junk, Facebook is worthless, updates don't do anything.
"
"Why don't you actually fix something that will actually make Facebook work.
"
"Worked better in iphone before.
"
"One star just cause i have to leave one!
"
"Update to my last review.
"
"I dont like the old facebook
"
"Terribly dissappointed...
"
"It is the worst app
"
"I've had this app for a year now and after all the negative comments and feedback, they still can't get it right.
"
"Nice Improvement
"
"I can comment on others and use on my pc.
"
"Latest updates are a huge improvement on my phone, FB must have finally gotten some decent android devs!
"
"I expect iPad levels of functionality on my Android tablet folks.
"
"F.b. Seems to dictate want it wants now moving to Google
"
"Therefore this facebook is horrible
"
"I've tried uninstalling this app and reinstalling it with no luck.
"
"I don't know who you hired but I could serially develop a better app.
"
"Lay outs good....
"
"Why is it this app gets worse and worse everytime its updated.
"
"Worst update yet.
"
"Such a stuped error in programing facebook !!!!
"
"This is the fastest version of facebook u will ever see till date.
"
"The new update has certainly made a lot changes including the new view of comments and also a very quick interface.
"
"seems like developer problem.
"
"I've uninstalled and re installed.
"
"I have seen monkeys throwing crap at the zoo do a better job!
"
"All other apps work fine and I need to close the FB app in the taskbar and reopen.
"
"I love Facebook.
"
"I be on facebook all day and night
"
"You say you always improve it with your updates.
"
"Your just keep creating more issues.
"
"Goood app
"
"I Love FaceBook<3
"
"The ios app is 100% better this piece of crap....
"
"Do you pay your testers in bananas and a back scratch?
"
"Totally a first world problem...
"
"But please address these issues, as I'm clearly NOT the only one with them
"
"Pretty tired of dealing with it.
"
"I like to use it a lot.
"
"Seriously am frustrated with this update !
"
"FIX IT or I'm deleting my Facebook .
"
"Cuz my phone is the only way I can go on it !!
"
"This app sucks!!!
"
"It doesn't even work properly.
"
"To easy do the chat
"
"I hate this new update!
"
"Its almost 2013 and this app is still going backwards its really crippled by 90 %!!!
"
"too far from pc version but good
"
"Upgrading to 4 stars.
"
"Those are still planning to update, i reccommend that u shoudn't.
"
"3 stars because this app is pretty good and fast.
"
"Quite satisfied with last couple updates.
"
"Facebook is da best
"
"This update sucks man.
"
"Make a functional app before anything.
"
"Makes millions.
"
"Fix it soon Many android's has the same prblm.
"
"Hate this new Facebook.
"
"Plz bring it back in the app this new thing is piece of shit it was not fast before but atleast it was functional
"
"For a social media giant you would expect something that at least works.
"
"Much better than old versions.
"
