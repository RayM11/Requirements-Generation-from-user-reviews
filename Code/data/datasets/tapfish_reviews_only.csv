Review
"great game, but too many repetitive bubble tip pop-ups.
"
"give more fish bucks and lower prices, but it was awsome
"
"i hate that after i get a new phone i have to start the whole game over.
"
"wish breeding was quicker but looooooooove the app anyways!!!
"
"love this game but it lags on my phone
"
"like but freezes phone alot new event frozen on training so can't complete a little disappointing, and wish could use coins instead of game dollars to revive fish.
"
"it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble, then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
"
"why is algae reappearing in certain tanks immediately after cleaning....
"
"i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks
"
"forcing me to update is pretty rude.....
"
"i was on level 36 and now i update and lose everything all because you decide to force me to update to a flawed version, thank you for ruining this game!!!!!
"
"wish there was a faster way though to get more fishbucks.
"
"give more fish bucks and lower prices, but it was awsome
"
"it's a great game very relaxing for me an keeps me busy so i never get bored,one thing needs fixin,ukeep same game even if switchin phone.
"
"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
"
"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
"
"wish could get fish bux easier
"
"only one thing to make it better, a sign in. so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
"
"wish best decorations were available with coins instead of bucks.
"
"wish i could earn bucks instead of buying them.
"
"cost of best fish too high.
"
"did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable frog to breed
"
"would someone like to explain why the frog challenge just ended a day early?
"
"wish there were faster growing fish and that there were minigames to play to kill time
"
"the only thing i wish is that if you can turn coins into fish bucks.
"
"like 10,000 coins could get you 2 fish bucks and 20,000 coins could get you 5 or 6.
"
"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
"
"love this game but is so hard 2 earn fish bucks
"
"but maybe have the option of buying fish bucks with the coins, something to get more and faster.
"
"didn't get my $22 fish bucks for downloading ship wrecked!!
"
"this game can be very fun but it takes up so i much of your time taking care of the fish!
"
"if you don't feed them for a day all the fish die, it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
"
"ripped off    75 bucks...
"
"beware of this app,   when  a fish burp's  good bye to your fish bucks.
"
"get your missing, lost or stolen fish bucks back.
"
"and refuse to replace missing buck's.......  :(  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :'( :'(  :'( :'( :'( :'( :'(
"
"wish you could earn more fishbucks within the game itself, but overall its cute and easy to play.
"
"love it just wish there were more breedable fish that didn't cost fish bucks
"
"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
"
"if only it was easier to get fish bucks....
"
"great game, just wish it didn't take so long to breed the fish! 3 days is a bit much.
"
"love it think its cool only complaint is i don't get the free fish bucks from the earn free fish bicks part
"
"poor would not connect to the internet: (
"
"its plays well but items ony last so long
"
"i love the game i just wish it didn't take so long to get money
"
"i love this game but i do wish that you could get fish buck way easier
"
"love the game,  but it needs to have more fish you can buy with coins and less that you have to use the fishbucks for.
"
"to complete the game will cost u more than $200.
"
"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
"
"the only doubt is u can't get fishbucks 4 fishcash or whatever it is.
"
"its just i ain't willing to spend money for fish money
"
"great ggame but takes too much internet
"
"only thing i would change are the notifications.
"
"would rate it a 5 star but for some odd reason i can't breed any of my mystery fish so it's like if i bought them for nothing!:(
"
"also lower the fish prizes a bit please and it will definitely be a 5 star game for me!!!:)
"
"pass time favorite ,only dwn side is can't get fish bucks
"
"great game can't stop playing, just wish breeding didn't take so long
"
"this app does events all the time that make you accidentally use ""fish bucks"" which are almost impossible to earn and all the coolest stuff you have yo pay for with.
"
"never got my 100 dollar worth fishbucks
"
"i went to open my game an it says new bee event but nothin is there so u went to see if it needed updated an its up to date.
"
"plus i lost 20 fish bucks during the frog event & i'm not sure how it happened.
"
"takes way too long to breed fish though.
"
"and it is irritating that you don't stay in the shop when buying multiple fish.
"
"clicked on  bubble and accidentally lossed all fishbucks.
"
"would like to get the fb back.
"
"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
"
"also, alot of the free buck opportunities, do.not give you.the bucks and the fish prices have become outrageous :(
"
"i would say the only thing i dont like about it is that its hard to earn fish bucks,and alot of fish you have to buy with the fish bucks....
"
"so i would rate this app as perfect if you were able to get free fish bucks and or earn them easier...
"
"and twice since the update all of my fish bucks have disappeared.
"
"i want my 20 fish bucks back
"
"love this gane but would be great if the fish grew faster
"
"wish there was a better to get fish bucks
"
"its fun and is like having real fish could do with some different plants and decorations to be added on though.
"
"needs more ""free cash & coins"", but over all very cool game.
"
"i like the app but it wont let me buy fish so there is point keeping the app.
"
"would like more coin fish less $ fish and the tasks given to be for coin fish not $ fish
"
"the fish that i'm breeding for the current event are disappearing when i move them into the tank.
"
"i would really like if i could move to another device it seems to be taking a lot of space!
"
"just wish you could earn fish bucks faster lol
"
"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
"
"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
"
"great only thing that sucks is fish buck free offers. when ya try putting in numbers it kicks you out of the offers.
"
"easier way to get bucks
"
"force closes alot but still love it.....
"
"great time waster but to many fish for fish bucks i mean i have no money for fish bucks there needs to be less fish for fish bucks.
"
"pretty easy to use and hamless unless you get greedy to have mmore coins or money.
"
"good game but need ways to earn more fishbucks
"
"i do like this game but i want to be able to earn fish bucks.because all the fish i like are are fish bucks for example phrina is 20 fish bucks ani only have 2.
"
"love this wish there want so many things to buy with bucks.
"
"love this game wish there was better ways to earn fish bucks though
"
"great game but would be better if didn't force close so much
"
"the game is great the only problem is that my memory on my phone fills up to fast and the weather makes it lage a little but been a loyal fan and player for a year or so.
"
"drains battery on galaxy s2 epic 4g.
"
"sold fish bred during breeding even but game cheated me out of 6k+ coins.
"
"wish you could earn/find more fishbucks.....
"
"but not anymore can't breed the fish that i want too buy fish to breed and won't let me do it what is the point of this game...
"
"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
"
"cons - sometimes gliches -waaaaay too hard to get fish bucks
"
"love the game feel that there needs to be more breedable fish and more ways to earn fish bucks
"
"would like to see more scale.
"
"please fix it keeps sayin unable to conecte when i go to by fish but its a 5 star i love this game
"
"good game but it just wants you to spend money :/
"
"its cute but too many things cost a lot of fish bucks and its hard to get them....
"
"bucks no so fun.
"
"game is ok and the timing is not fun either but fool fishes
"
"every time i try to play it force closes.
"
"have lost fish bucks for no reason...
"
"wish there were a way to trade or get fish from friends!
"
"tack to long to load but good game
"
"fish bucks too expensive
"
"its fun, but fishbucks and coins are way too hard to get.
"
"you also should be able to do more things with your fish.
"
"bee playing this game since two years ago wheni first started with my iphone ; tthe only complain is i cant carry forward all my points and levels after i switched to note 2!
"
"since last update i do not have some fish.
"
"getting free fish bucks is getting harder & harder & has not been updated in a mo. customer service is great and this fish game is way better then others.
"
"there is another glitch w/ feeding friends  takes up alot of space i have to uninstall & re install & restore alot!
"
"definitely need more coin fish...
"
"is there anyway to get your game back if you switch phones??
"
"too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
"
"also it freezes a lot
"
"wish you could get more coins, bucks, and spins faster.
"
"a moderately entertaining game but still requiring real money for fake fishbucks to do much of anything.
"
"i wish all the good fish wasn't so high
"
"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
"
"the cost to play is too high and the software is buggy.
"
"cost of fish bucks is unreasonable as well.
"
"fun game, i love the variety of fish and decorations but it's so easy for your fish to die!
"
"i enjoy playing tap fish except for how hard it is to get fish bucks.
"
"just would like to get more bucks for doing things
"
"i like  it but they dont give enough money or coinsand if u dont login everyday your fish die, i have a job soi cant play games everyday so they should have babysitter fish to buy for like 20 coins who freeze tank for your vacation needs
"
"but some of the items an fish cost to much real money.
"
"a little cluttered and slow..
"
"only wish there was a way to retrieve deleted tanks and transfer tanks from one phone to another.
"
"its a little slow starting out.
"
"coins are super tight but the games pretty fun
"
"need more ways to get fish bucks!
"
"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
"
"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
"
"i love it just want more bucks rewards
"
"slow but fun
"
"i used to have fishlive but it crashed on me all the time.
"
"why is tapfish disabled
"
"forse closes allot when using certain feat.
"
"updates killed my fish.
"
"deffenetly 4 stars only 4 because a little hard when ur not able to play for a while
"
"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
"
"i liked the game,but i needed to update my phone and application did not open,sad,had to uninstall,there were no instructions how to trouble shoot.
"
"great game but too slow
"
"only problem is getting fish bucks to buy everything
"
"love the game but sometime freezes
"
"why can't we exchange coins in for fish bucks?
"
"would have gotten 5 stars if i could of kept the game when i changed phones.
"
"becomes addicting and sometimes it had to froce close
"
"this game is really fun i like it exept everything cost too much
"
"i just wish it would quit shutting dowm for no reason.
"
"if u guys can fix that and stop wantimg so many fishbucks for things
"
"very fun good way to pass time could fix lag though
"
"it keeps glitching, and most times it tries to force close.
"
"we both love it i just wish u could make more money faster
"
"jus wish it was easier to earn bucks.
"
"great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
"
"and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
"
"game is ok but there should be a way to get fish bucks like so many coins = one fish buck or something
"
"it loads and updates sooo slow!
"
"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
"
"won't even let me download it but rated it any way:-)
"
"love this game only thing i'm mad about is i got a new phone and lost all my fish and could not get anything back :-(
"
"this game is actually really fun, i wish you could get fish bucks easier though.
"
"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
"
"some easier way of earing bucks would be better as there are challenges that you can't meet without them.
"
"with the recent android update, tapfish has gotten soooo slow!
"
"i wish there were more challanges at a time.
"
"and not so many requiring fish bucks to buy things.
"
"just doesn't make sense to pay for fake money!
"
"also, there are too few options for those of us who can't/won't spend tons of money on fish bucks.
"
"aren't you making enough money through ads?
"
"do you really want to continue trying to bore us into buying fish bucks?
"
"im not a fan of how the majority of fish and ornaments require ""fish bucks""
"
"it kills time but there needs to be a way to ""pause""
"
"i downloaded shipwrecked and its been 2 days since i downloaded it and no free fish bucks are appearing in my fish bucks spot that's 22 fish bucks you owe me give them in 2days or i uninstall
"
"accidently uninstalled reinstalled and restarted my sis went on and added me and it came up with my old 1 and all the fish dead but otherwise its great
"
"game should save itself to my play account.
"
"only wish you could change coins for bucks....
"
"i updated tapfish because my phone said i had to, and the game had totally changed..
"
"it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble..
"
"then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
"
"like the game, but i wish you could earn more fish bucks faster.
"
"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
"
"great game but hard to get fishbucks which u need to get stuff in game
"
"takes a lot of time to level up and speed ups cost bucks.
"
"i love playing this game i just wished i could gain levels much faster amiga...
"
"love the game just take to long to generate cash and bucks
"
"way too slow for my phone.
"
"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
"
"only one thing to make it better, a sign in.
"
"so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
"
"now ive lot all my prizes  that's again tap fish, you're getting deleted finally
"
"it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
"
"ripped off 75 bucks...
"
"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
"
"it takes a while to load at first but its worth it!
"
"it's fun but there isn't much to do after you clean the tank, feed and love the fish.
"
"the bucks are impossible to earn, not enough instructions and to much waiting around for breeding to happen.
"
"pretty cool but everything is expensive
"
"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
"
"i just wanna say that i love tapfish i just have one suggestion can u guys plz come up with some kind of password so that when friends who dont know what their doing grab ur phone and start messing with stuff dont sell all ur fish and mess up ur tanks.
"
"i think there should be a way to level up faster because it takes forever trying to level up, and maybe there should also be a breedable catagory for lazy people (such as i) that way we dont have to spwnd a half hour trying to find breedable fish
"
"really good game only bad thing is tht most of the tsks u have to have fish bucks apart from that it is good
"
"do more batfish
"
"can't breed new fish often cause i can't get more than 2 tanks to bread, then it takes on average 3 days to breed one fish lol.
"
"however i wish a lot of the fish did not cost as much fish bucks as they do. its hard 2 earn enough of them in order 2 complete the tasks & it's expensive 2 buy them.
"
"plus it is hard to get fish bucks.
"
"love this game but i agree there should be a way to level up faster
"
"could be a good game but is very slow & demanding of time
"
"cute game but have to play it every day or fish will die of starvation
"
"just wish it didn't take as long as it does to breed fish.
"
"i don't realy like the pictures and how it's so flat and boring, but i like the huge the selection of fish.
"
"the game is pretty fun jusr wish that the fish bucks were easier to get and everything was cheaper but overall p0retty fun i would recomend it also wish the fish didn't die so fast
"
"fun game but super hard to earn fishbucks
"
"enjoyable game,,,slow to start though.
"
"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
"
"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks w/o having to buy them or download so many other apps.
"
"love the game but not 5 stars because the fish die way to fast
"
"love this game but i wish you could get more fish bucks for free.
"
"boring and stupid because you need lots of money to buy things and they barely give u any
"
"it's fun just long and alot of things you need fish bucks for but you barely get them for free
"
"for 2 days and now it won't open any more
"
"i wish i never updated my tap fish game i used to be able to buy puffer fish that would bring in the $$ but not any more.
"
"i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks to get all of the crazy fishies!
"
"only complaint it takes a few seconds to load.
"
"i love to play, but you need to spend lots of money to get fish to breed.
"
"needs more fish and new fish.
"
"could go a bit faster though
"
"you can't do much without fish bucks and they cost $.
"
"game shuts down alot but other than that its great.
"
"stupid game give my more fish bucks
"
"hard to obtain fish bucks.
"
"great game, but needs more fish for higher levels.
"
"i'm level 54 and there is nothing for several more levels.
"
"like alot, love fish, dont like 2 spend real money or have 2 download stuff u dont want just 2 get more bucks or coins.
"
"needs fake money 2 spend.
"
"takes to long to level up and most quests take $ to complete!
"
"it doesn't give u hardly any coins for tending to ur fish!
"
"however, it takes way too long to earn bucks.
"
"the challenges are fun at first but then it gets old.
"
"it constantly asks to buy more bucks.
"
"there should be an option to exchange coins for bucks.
"
"4/5 hard go get fish bucks but fun
"
"there should be an easier way to get bucks. how 'bout every 500 coins you get you get one?
"
"that way people can revive their fish without having to pay as often.
"
"i got a new phone and    now i cannot get back into the game that i have   spent so much money on i have been well over $1000.00 and it's a shame to lose everything that i just built up.
"
"i paid money to remove ads and i still got them
"
"but should have a way of buying fish bucks using your coins.
"
"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
"
"very good game, some lagging but that might just be my phone.
"
"a little cluttered and slow.
"
"also alot of focus on fish bucks, which are hard to get without buying them.
"
"i wish there was more way to earn fish bucks.
"
"this last update stole millions of coins from my tank not to mention all the bs with the frog event.
"
"the only downfall is hard to get fish bucks without buying them.
"
"maybe trading coins for bucks or awarding more bucks when leveling up.
"
"would rate higher but to obtain breeder fish and other things you need to pay2play and i just can't offord it.
"
"dislike bubble tips and smiley faces on feed fish.
"
"it is very fun but make it a little more interactive with the fish
"
"i wish they could put in a permanet mini game to get fish bucks,coins,fish or decorations ethre
"
"its a cool game but its stupid you can progress if u don't have bucks wilhich u need credit card for
"
"it'll glitch everytime i go to play store then exit it and click the game itself on the phone it just goes right back to play store
"
"not giving all fishbucks when you download games also when foggy event was over did not receive breedable frog did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable froggy
"
"it does take an awfully long time to level up,  and it's unfortunate that so many basic things can only be bought with ""fish bucks"" which are very difficult to earn many of without paying money.
"
"and many quests require you to buy these things.
"
"i just wish you could advance up quicker yeah you can speed up your fish eggs to hatch.
"
"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
"
"it won't let me connect to the server. i report it every time but it is always the same thing.
"
"won't let me participate in the easter event.
"
"every time i catch the fish, it says ""image not found""
"
"i love it (but why will they make the decoration's and every thing so much you can just get a fish with that money and fish buck's
"
"i 'v played this app before it crashs alot but i'm giving it a second chance if it did not crash i would have this app forevef
"
"its fun except every thing needs fishbucks
"
"love this game but very disappointed with the adds that pop up!
"
"you should monitor what's advertised.
"
"hate waiting but great
"
"takes a while to load but it already filled the last two hours of fun
"
"it would be better if the game will allow me and my phone not to be on the internet all the time and still be this fun & cool!
"
"good but the good fish cost fish bucks which you have to buy with real money and the fish are way to expensive.
"
"it also take way to long to level up.
"
"can't breed the fish i want.
"
"fish bucks are too much!
"
"thank you tap fish makers but please have more games to earn fish bucks !
"
"wish it didn't take so long to breed special event fish.
"
"after the update the bubble icon is taking a lot of time this game is entertaining but it must be fast so to be fast please remove bubble icon
"
"i also love the breeding just wish it didnt take  do long to breed!
"
"the only thing i don't like is that if you miss the deadline on an event cuz of work or anything there is no extension.
"
"changed phones and lost everything which stinks.
"
"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
"
"only wish fish bucks were easier to come by
"
"there needs to be a way to transfer my game to another phone.
"
"spenf a lot if time and money on this then got a new phone and am having to start over!
"
"ive switched phones, downloaded tap fish and i have to start all over again i believe i had pleanty more fish than the 2 i have now and my fish bucks are gone how do i get my fish tanks back.?
"
"or be able to buy more with coins.
"
"all the fish's eggs should be displayed under one head, instead of various categories and also the selling star rating should be displayed
"
"takes too long to move up levels though
"
"great app try to purchase fish bucks though other apps but, still waiting the only bad thing
"
"but i do think a 12 hr breeding time for a total of 90 fish to breed is a bit long for shorter event time.
"
"im in love with this game, but fish bucks need to go i hate that.
"
"live wallpaper needs to be fixed also : (
"
"the new event is not giving me the prize when i bred my fish and 11 hours thats a little to long to be able to get everything.
"
"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
"
"changed from 5 stars because the new valentines event takes 12hrs to breed and 6 days to complete.
"
"this game is so  fun except tht the baby fish take for ever to grow
"
"i like the game save ur bucks their hard to come by seem like they want u 2 use cash to advance other than that good game
"
"i like the events, but sometimes it kind of stinks when you don't have the fish bucks for them.
"
"and you really don't have good deals for fish bucks.
"
"love this game, but i wish there was an easier way to transfer game from one phone to the next.
"
"never succewd open even the internet connection available and in a hi speed wifi.
"
"this game takes up the most space on my phone.
"
"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
"
"the graphics and fonts overlap!
"
"but wish the fish weren't so expensive or cost so many fish bucks
"
"i love playing tapfish and wanna thank u for retrieving the coins i couldn't get but i really wish i wouldn't of lost all my tanks and all the work i had in this game for the past yr i lost a lot of tanks and fish that took days to earn and the money spent while i played .but i had to get a replacement phone ,same phone just wish i wouldst of lost all that i worked hard for should be a way to not loose games that would b awesome !
"
"i want alot of fish bucks for free please
"
"game not bad, but you start off slow.
"
"wish there was an easier way to get coins and cash.
"
"joys of fun only downfalls is it takes forever to level up and fish cost way to much fish bucks.
"
"not easy trying to earn fish bucks without actually spending real money.
"
"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
"
"it is very show moving store to i don't want to spend real money to get fish bucks.
"
"it takes a long time to accumulate bucks to buy things or to speed up the breeding process.
"
"i just wished that i could earn fish bucks faster
"
"need more fish bucks free!
"
"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
"
"good game but constantly crashes.!
"
"cool just wish you got fish bucks often
"
"i still can't breed mystery fish.
"
"ilove this game and so does my 3 yr old grandson he always asks gamma can i play fish with you only problem is when i changed phones i lost it all but it is fun rebuilding
"
"some of the valentine species are a bit odd though!
"
"should get more free fish bucks though
"
"very addicting and time comsuming but it could use more ways to earn fish bucks.
"
"my only complaints are that we should be able to still get our prizes from events even after the event is over.
"
"the other thing is that you should have like bubbles or something pop up so we can earn xp, fb or coins.
"
"the valentine game is way too long,12 hours to breed, so no way to get half way through ribbing three breeding tanks.
"
"note the disappearing bucks.
"
"the fish bucks are too hard to get.
"
"its fun with all the cute fish but i wish there were more events because they are fun
"
"during updates & events, i was losing my daily prizes & my free spin on the 5th day.
"
"i love it just want more bucks rewards
"
"it's a really addictive game i love it but it keeps crashing my phone it always tells me to force close some of the breedable fish are to expensive and it's hard to get fish bucks without having to buy them with ur own cash ain't doing it uninstalled! !
"
"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks and more breedables for coins
"
"if you could buy more fish bucks using just fish coins thatd be awesome.
"
"fun game don't like the fact that you have use real money to buy fishbuck
"
"slow to load but addictive
"
"good but taking days to grow fish
"
"or be able to buy more with coins.
"
"umm its trying to make me use my brothers acount to buy fish bucks ither than that good
"
"doesn't save and won't let me uninstall
"
"wish it was free instead of pay credit card.lame.don't download this game at all.
"
"populate tanks as you wish for fun or to unlock new fish & decorations.
"
"great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
"
"and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
"
"decent game,tough to earn fishbucks
"
"love it but somtices it forcefully close
"
"wish it didn't take forever to level up though.
"
"would give 5 stars but its slow loading different things.
"
"the only issue i have with this game is that it can be quite expensive!
"
"it takes forever to earn ""fish bucks"" and almost everything requires you to use them for purchases, speed ups, most decorations, etc.
"
"so real but hard to get fish bucks!
"
"to pass a quest you need to buy a fish that cost 49 fishbucks and at the end you could sell it but its only worth some coins i thinking in removing game i dont recommend this game.
"
"been playing for like a year now the only thing that bothers me is the fish bucks it should be easier to get them and less fish bucks for fish and items!
"
"i gave it a five but i think events should last a little longer so that you get a chance to comlete them.
"
"one other thing is some items shouldn't cost so much and you should have more chances to earn fishbucks.
"
"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
"
"too hard to earn fish bucks/dollars and too many $$ only items.
"
"reasonable price for extra coins and $$ but should be able to do all things without sending $$ with ads displayed.
"
"you gotta have fish bucks for a lot of things.
"
"you can only get fish bucks by buying it or clicking their ads.
"
"i can't open tapfish since update.
"
"i love the game but wish it was easier to get fish bucks and quicker
"
"i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
"
"just wish once you wished a certain level you could buy mystery breedables with coins and not just fish bucks
"
"stores stuff needlessly.
"
"have to clear data and restore game periodically in order to free up memory.
"
"restore sometimes installs data that is 5+ days out of date, so progress is lost.
"
"i think it would be nice to earn fish bucks in other ways.
"
"may be you could buy fish bucks with your coins, charge us a sum of coins you couldbuy fish bucks.
"
"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
"
"the graphics and fonts overlap!
"
"fish bucks need to be easier to receive though.
"
"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
"
"the only thing preventing the fifth star is that some people are able to 'cheat' by rooting their phones and giving themselves unlimited bucks.
"
"like very much but wish fish bucks were easier to get.
"
"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
"
"it lags a bit and takes awhile to level up, but it's still entertaining.
"
"just if it were easier to get bucks, i would have gave it 5 stars.
"
"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
"
"need 2 come way down on all prices & giv out a lot mor gold & fish bucks!
"
"i love it but the new quest game is so dumb why the f$!k cant u earn fishbucks instead of coins i have over 4million coins i need bucks.
"
"i had to restart due to accidental tank deleting.
"
"we should have our stuff returned not deleted!
"
"where are my fish bucks  i did what they told me but disnt received fish buckz
"
"addictive, still a little glitchy and epensive
"
"but memory it takes up is a joke.
"
"just wish u didn't have to buy fish bums for a lot of ur tasks.
"
"i love the game i just wish there was a easier way to get fish bucks.
"
"i am getting a new phone and i hope i will be able to keep my tap fish progress.
"
"is there anything that i can do to transfer my progress to my new phone?
"
"i do not want to loose my fish, 300,000 + coins and my earned bucks.
"
"between forced closes, freezing, & constant charging fishbucks for most items required for quests, i'm just done.
"
"i just wish it wasn't so hard to get extra fish bucks without having to buy them.
"
"a good fun game but the free stuff gets boring very fast and requires real money to buy more stuff
"
"it's need to help make money faster
"
"wud like easier ways 2 earn fish bucks
"
"this is a goid game but i wish you didnt have to buy the fish bucks.
"
"so far tapfish is going good i just dont like it when you have to wait for the fish bucks
"
"would be 5 but u need cash for almost everything.
"
"got up to level 60 and lost all my progress.
"
"it takes forever to level up and get enough coins to buy the stuff you want for your tanks.
"
"just wish it were easier to earn fish bucks.
"
"great game but if level up is going to be so slow fish bucks should be easier to earn or buy.
"
"for some reason i can't even purchase fish bucks (error).
"
"force closes alot but still love it.....
"
"love this game, would rate higher but after about 3 weeks it now is telling me that i have to connect to the internet.
"
"lower the prices on things have an income of money if done 5 stars
"
"not a bad game, but annoyingly slow
"
"its totally fun and addicting but you run out of fish bucks and  coins to easily
"
"fun needs more ways to win prizes.
"
"cheaper fish
"
"this game had great graphics and a wide variety of different fish, but you needed a lot of ""fish bucks"" to buy most of the ones you need for your achievements.
"
"i am addicted to playing it but i wish you could earn more fish bucks more easily cause i am now stuck and can't complete any task without any fish bucks and can't get any fish bucks cause i can't complete tasks
"
"just wish the really cool fish and accessories weren't quite so expensive.
"
"would be nice if it was easier to get fish bucks.
"
"it can be fun but using the new version and it still loses your money.
"
"this app stole  75 bucks beware of this app,  it locks up,  and or is  glitchy the (game) will stell your hard earned money from you.
"
"go ahead and buy fish bucks, or download the apps they want you to try to earn bucks, and have a fish burp good bye fish bucks.
"
"and refuse to replace missing buck's.
"
"i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
"
"would be 5 stars if adverts did'nt keep on popping up and the coins and fish bucks were all free
"
"new year event start on ios devices but not on android devices?
"
"we just hate waiting on breed process ;)
"
"pretty fun to play for awhile but tedious must keep up with it on a daily basis in order to receive full benefit will need to purchase fish bucks so if your cheap this isn't game for you
"
"but sucks because it says you can earn fishbucks by downloading apps and doing other things when it doesn't its such a joke you can't get anywhere in this game without the fishbucks, and if it freezes my phone up again, im done with it, ive had to start over several times in this game, have, thought bout buying fishbucks but i will be damned if i pay for something that will just be lost!
"
"the game is great except i got a new phone and couldn't transfer it over so i had to start over.
"
"also it keeps stopping and closing for no reason.
"
"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
"
"i found a better fish game with cuter fish i got tired of this game force closing and i cant seem to make enough fish bucks to keep my fish alive i got really bored but it was fun for awhile
"
"love it just try giving more free fish bucks as prizes.
"
"have yet to have a force close.
"
"well, its good but it takes too long to breed and u can only do one at a time
"
"but it's getting very frustrating with it closing down constantly.
"
"i have a suggestion also for breeding is it possible to do the same on both sets of breeding where if there's only certain fish that can breed together that all the others disappear like the mystery tanks do??
"
"it's gotten better not sure if it's from upgrades you've done or that i've upgraded my phone which by the way for some reason could not get my old game
"
"just wish i started off with more fishbucks
"
"in the last few days though i've noticed that the fish aren't swimming smoothly like they usually do, don't know if it needs an update i've tried logging out and in but its still doing it.
"
"i love it but i wish the fish didn't take so long to grow up
"
"just wish you didn't have wait so long for the fish to breed.
"
"why is tapfish disabled
"
"this game could have better information,help,better upgrade on this tapfish game,better news,no pay credit is lousy.
"
":-( after the latest android update.my 70 tanks are gone.
"
"it only lets me breed 2 fish in the mystery breeds.
"
"which either takes forever to earn, costs actual money, or you have to take surveys and download/play other apps to get.
"
"otherwise i like it.
"
"it is totally awesome!
"
"i got a shark,a pipe fish, and a lion fish
"
"like this app.

"a fun diversion.
"
"awesome great game
"
"love this game!!!
"
"amazing i'm having so much fun :)
"
"great game, makes time go by really fast
"
"i love this game!
"
"it's fun, and challenging when you're trying to level and complete quests.
"
"very addicting!
"
"the only thing i frown on is the most stuff cost fish bucks.
"
"when ever i try to breed, the fish are there but whenever i tap on them it only gives me one to breed when there are several there.
"
"i can't visit any of my neighbor tanks....
"
"i think you shuld make a place where you can change fish mony into fish buks and fish buks into fish mony.
"
"then after that update it wunt let me play the missions.
"
"after this last event i can't breed and i lost a lot of fish.
"
"after this latest update three tanks of fish are missing an i can no longer breed fish.
"
"when i went to play and i had my breeding tank  ready to put the fish in tank they was gone .
"
"just wish events were easier to make your goals.
"
"some of the fish too expensive to buy but overly i adore this game.
"
"or such things it does make things go by a little bit faster breeding does take a little too long i think right now i'm waiting 2 days that's a bit long and i'm not spending money sorry i have a baby that needs my money first.
"
"wish fish bucks were easier to get.
"
"i had one issue where i had to delete my second tank but other than that its been awesome
"
"its not excellent because its hard to get money and still have fish.
"
"epic game ever but give ways to get more fish bucks easier :)
"
"also, make prices lower
"
"love it wish the tanks were a little cheaper and wish they would have more ways to earn fish bucks instead of having to pay once they do that it will be a 5 star app
"
"it takes forever to level up on this game.
"
"i play on my ipod and would really like to be able to transfer my game to my android.
"
"but why is it so slow and small on my motorola atrix..
"
"i purchased 2 20 fish bucks packages in the last couple weeks and neither showed up.
"
"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
"
"i just wish it didn't freeze so much and there was an easier way to get coins
"
"beginner game started up & will not restore.
"
"i have did the earn free bucks and have not received any thing
"
"per tapfish ""somehow my tapfish went corrupt & start the game over"".
"
"apart from it popping up telling me to leave 5*s all the time its a good game, wish there was more things to do without paying real money though..
"
"it could be little better if there is a way to cash in coins for bucks  or at least easy way to get free bucks ...
"
"okay here's another idea space theme astronaut fish and it makes aliens a spaceship decoration and planets and space backgrounds and space decorations and meteor shower that moves and a moon that turns or the earth mini solar system for a reward and rockets and moon rovers and flying saucers.
"
"there should be more events once one is over.
"
"good game but it can be slow at progressing
"
"i lost everything that i spent over a year doing.
"
"its a brilliant game until it starts freezing and forcing close but the kids do love it.
"
"i luv this game but it takes days to hatch most eggs and u have to spend money to complete tasks, but it is a free game, ppl have 2 make money!
"
"it would be nice if we could purchase more than one item at a time, rather than going back and forth for same item.
"
"it never fetches data from server cant able to play it till now...:(
"
"i really like the game but am disapointed that most of the objects you need or want to buy must be bought with fish bucks other than that grea game
"
"wish there were more fish bucks rewards though.
"
"good game overall but eats memory so far
"
"good game but crashes alot
"
"breeding takes to long and more breeding tanks cost too much but this is a great game i'm 35 and all my kids love it from 5 ye old to 7, 11,and 15 ye old ty for a fun addictive game!
"
"can't play for more than a few minutes before it force closes.
"
"per tapfish ""somehow my tapfish went corrupt & start the game over"".
"
"always hangs and consumes a lot of memory..
"
"add tadpoles!! :)
"
"i have more then ten of all 4 frog breads why cant i claim the 7th collection item?
"
"i have 2 limited breedable fish and when i try to breed them it is saying i don't have any limited breedable fish somebody please fix this so that i can breed my fish?
"
"but for the last week every time i turn on the app, it freezes my touch screen up.
"
"and all of the other fish cost fish bucks while its already so hard to get coins!
"
"need 2 be able 2 get more things  easier like fish bucks...
"
"uninstalled kept force closing on me and i lost everything..
"
"i've played this on 2 phones now and i wish my old fish had followed from apple to android...
"
"rebuilding my collection of fish is gonna be expensive,  wish it was possible to buy buck fish for higher coin prices or earn bucks easier.
"
"bubble tips get on my nerves ...
"
"pop up to many times.
"
"aware but no help - the bubble-pop event ended two months ago & i have 24 half-evolved fish-bubbles flashing-red & i can't pop, sell, kill or delete them.
"
"this game suckes don't install its a rip off this company just wants your money
"
"can there be a way to trade coins for bucks please!
"
"fish bucks are to hard to get and to buy the good breedable fish you have to use alot of your hard earned fish bucks
"
"i was on level 12, then had to reset my phone to get a new phone, switched out my sd card, memory card, and battery (yes i saved data before removal) placed everything in my new phone, and it started from the beginning.
"
"having the same problem as everyone else, can't even access game now.
"
"it's a bit slow sometimes on my metropcs optimus m, but could be my phone's fault.
"
"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks.
"
"we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.
"
"i have gotten a data parsing error for the second time.
"
"runs a little slow sometimes.
"
"actually five times to be exact when the submarine was filled to the max n several other times when i only had a few items.
"
"dont last long bucuz everything is so high to buy with fish bucks!!
"
"breeding time should be shortened too.
"
"fun but shuts down frequently
"
"would be five stars but the fish inch across the screen and it lags when i try to bring up a menu or anything but when i have a menu brought up the fish swim smoothly instead of inching but if the lag was fixed it would be 5stars!!!
"
"just started getting error messages.
"
"the game constantly freezes and force closes.
"
"and it would be nice if i could chat with a friend who is using an i phone.
"
"lower prices please
"
"but when i had to change phones i lost everything and couldn't remember my account cause i had it for so long.
"
"well only one problem and its to hard to earn fish bucks ples fix it i love the game so i will give 5 stars
"
"i love tha game but it started me all over twice & gave me fish bucks like that part but starting all over again i don't like
"
"lots of fun to play but does crash sometimes on my droid 2
"
"would like to be able to earn  more fish bucks!
"
"you get 1300 fish bucks for $100.
"
"love the game, just wish you got more bucks to buy the more exotic fish as you are very ltd with coins
"
"wish it was cheaper and faster the backgrounds are too expensive!
"
"would giv mre stars bt is always shutn phne dwn bc of phne temp gts 2 hot!
"
"this is a great game but certain functions like cleaning the tank don't work well on a phone...
"
"with a few adjustments like making it easier to get cash and coins as well as the cleaning problem this would be an amazing game
"
"the only downside is that more than half the fish are only available thru in-game purchase of fishbucks.
"
"the fish cost to much and they made up half the fishes names
"
"i love the breeding events the best though, don't really like the submarine ones :/
"
"its upsetting thoughwhen u get a new phone, there is no way to transfer the game.
"
"also hard to earn fish bucks.
"
"why does it stop working for no reason, on my motorola droid razr maxx, and now it wont connect me into the game, fix please, i love my fish game!!
"
"still on daily bonus all i get is coins needs 2 b more fish bucks added and/or fish coins aren't doin me any good right now.
"
"get ffree fish with purchase of tank bucks is quite unfair to those of us who cant afford to spend $$ when new fish are avail for breeding.
"
"it would be a welcomed improvement to have the occasional reward of a fish buck or two.
"
"maybe its my phone bt the fish bucks needs more fixing.
"
"then into the last 2 days my pearls were stolen or it would say i had two clams and then only let me buy 1.
"
"this is a five star game as long as the parsing error is really fixed.
"
"needs 2 have easier ways 2 get fishbucks.
"
"keeps force closing
"
"bucks that it should be easier to win them in the events play.
"
"but needs to have a way to earn more fish bucks instead of buying them...
"
"too limited options on pairing fish bought with fish bucks and coins.
"
"this game is awesome only problem u have to pay 4 fish bucks i haven't used all mine yet but i am really low on them otherwise this game is great any1 who puts 1 star is crazy
"
"progress is slow.
"
"gr8 app passes some time away but i dnt like every time i open the app i get a pop up
"
"it is slower and the fish and decorations are smaller but tapfish keeps improving it so hopefully soon it is just as good as the iphone version.
"
"last quest had a ridiculous amount of monsters
"
"crashes a lot but still worth it
"
"this game for me right now is a four star game, but if they lower the fish prices and if sometimes they would also give you fish bucks when you sell a fish, it will totally be a five start game!!:)
"
"this sucks cause im at a low level and need to breed the neon tetra but can't get it cause it wont level up.
"
"was working now the server wont connect and if it does it takes 5 mins to do so..
"
"i have also lost lots of my fish bucks to revive my fish becos wen it force close i forget and where i left off, i come back, all my fish are dead.
"
"what happens to our app when one changes her phone, ie to another andriod?
"
"i worked so hard to level up and get my tanks only to get on this afternoon to find that everything reset.
"
"would be nice to get more breedable fish without having to pay real cash for em.
"
"i just wish it were easier to get fish bucks .....
"
"simply because all the cool stuff you can only get with fish bucks....
"
"apparently there is a problem with the transactions going through or something.....
"
"but other than the fish bucks problem.....
"
"love it best game ever other then sometimes slow
"
"i have an xmas event which i only got 3 xmas fish until the main breeding fish disappeared from my breeding tank.
"
"so now i cant play the event...
"
"not only that i also played the  egyptian events and also found i couldnt claim my gifts from it...
"
"i think these events need sorting out properly.
"
"this game is ok needs better graphics, and people should be able to earn more fish bucks more easily.
"
"now i have to get more bucks to revive them!
"
"it is a nice game for my 3 year old but it is very addictive and requires the purchase of fish bucks to really get any where in the game.
"
"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks n some fish weren't so expensive
"
"great except the stupid fish bucks feature, that makes you either buy them or download apps.
"
"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
"
"i'd play more if it was a little cheaper.
"
"also that bubble needs to go, it interferes and gets in the way..
"
"would be great if the makers of this game could come up with mini games to play in the game to get free fish bucks.
"
"should have easier ways to earn fish bucks
"
"fun game fish are to expensive tho
"
"good game some parts run aa lil slow..
"
"best one out yet n love how i can set as wallpaper only if it would quit force close all the time would b 5 *
"
"with this game  but howcome i sale the with bucks only coins you need to upgrade it
"
"only thing that i don't like is that getting fish bucks is so hard.
"
"the only thing i feel could use some improvement, are the few and far between chances you get to earn or win tapfish dollars.
"
"me personally,i would make it just a bit easier and not so random ,to win dollars.
"
"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
"
"why in the event that their is they dont give me what i collect i have to keep doing it all over in my cellphone
"
"it's good but wish it was easier to get fish bucks
"
"i love this game i have been playing it for years, unfortunately i had to get a new phone so i lost everything i had before, but its still a great stress relief game
"
"i just wish the breading was a little faster and you didn't have to spend 12 fish bucks to speed up a breed!
"
"just wish earning fish bucks wasn't so hard.
"
"just wish the thing on the bottom left corner would load.
"
"ever since i updated the game it wont load.
"
"just wish you could earn more fish bucks easier
"
"i've just completed the breeding event that gives the firework background on the new years event, but when i go to get it from the item store it doesn't say 0 coins like all the other event backgrounds, it's asking me for 70 odd fish bucks for it...
"
"it works some times but at times it very slow
"
"wish you could convert coins to fish bucks.
"
"i cant play the special events, so whats the point of playing at all.
"
"game for closes tanks size much bigger can't fetch data and lags!!!!
"
"most of my fish have disapered since i have updated it
"
"most recent update has caused me to not be able to breed any of my fish.
"
"i also lost the entire tank of the christmas fish that took me a week to breed!
"
"really liked this game, have for ages but i updated it and now i have lost 3/4 of my fish. :(
"
"i lost almost all my fish ?????????
"
"as soon as the latest update was finished loading,half my fish were gone!
"
"fun glitchy and game rips off your fishbucks from time to time also support doesn't refund them everytime they should but still fun
"
"wish it was easier to get more fish bucks or use coins to get the bettr fish.
"
"i love tapfish but the bubble is anoying.
"
"my only problem is that when i don't have internet for a few days all my fish die.
"
"it would be awesome if you could save to an sd card
"
"this last update does not allow me to clean the tanks so all my tanks are at 65% happy. i gave made no changes to my tanks but the update caused this.
"
"should lower fish prices or give more free fish bucks...
"
"tried to buy frog egg in the event for coins and it chraged me fish bucks instead several times and can only restore twice isn't fair i worked hard for those fish bucks please fix 3 stars deducted will go to 5 when fixed
"
"when i double tap on fish in event it wont she me how far my fish is from being complete
"
"i have my tanks for two day and i like it so far, i'm waiting for more ways to make money...
"
"no doubt all my fish are dead too!!
"
"its very irritating not to have enough fish bucks, you should allow us to earn it..
"
"fun game but if your phone dies you have to start from scratch.
"
"the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes it refuses to start and i have to reboot my tablet to get it to work which can be annoying.
"
"needs more ways to win fish cash but good game
"
"please make available to exchange the money on game for fish bucks
"
"it's rather decent, but the animations/graphics are rather sloppy and breeding is very slow.
"
"it's also hard to sort through the fish types in the shop.
"
"this game is great but when i set as wall paper i see half tank at my wall paper and blue at button i use htc inspire 4g but anyways i love it ^_^
"
"too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
"
"slow play when you start out.
"
"fun game, been having hours of enjoyment but started to force close regularly which is very frustrating.
"
"still wish prices w fish bucks werent so high.
"
"i really like this game, but the rates are expensive.
"
"pretty and fun, great time killer but wears on the battery
"
"pretty kool but i lost my name and tanks when i had to reset my tablet that sucks
"
"wish it was easier to get fishbucks.
"
"got a new phone and now everytime i play i have to re download the app or it wont let.
"
"im getting nowhere restoring to same spot over and over.
"
"i have just installed this game, straight away it crashed.
"
"rubbish it keeps crashing on me
"
"game love t so much fish bucks are a little high but its worth it
"
"always force closing
"
"its koo but it gets stuck a lot!!
"
"i love this but getting bucks only to hard pls make this as easier ....
"
"amazing but needs more events but get it downloaded,best game ever!!!
"
"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks. if those were easier i would play more often and i would actually buy them because i know i would be able to earn more after i blow through them so quickly because of the steep prices.
"
"i also read that there are some quests u must pay cash for and you can not skip it. we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.
"
"fix the ease of collecting coins, fish bucks, and lower prices in the store and it would be even more fun.
"
"but it's hard to level up and gather up some bucks...
"
"love game but freezes on daily spin
"
"it would be nice if you could earn fish bucks with some of the breeding fish.
"
"haven't had many problems with it forcing close since the update though.
"
"fun game but needs to be easier to earn fish bucks and the events need to start sooner...
"
"3 of my favorite fishes to buy and sell are all gone.
"
"da big icons and the bubble r so rediculous!
"
"but i ddnt like the way it looks at my toshiba tablet.
"
"its cool but it gets too repetitive there needs to be something more in between the growing, selling and breeding of the fishes.
"
"the only thing its missing is more fish,room and fish bucks its great but sometimes boring!
"
"fun but not enough to do everything takes so long. breeding, growing and so on
"
"i like this a lot, but force closes soooo often
"
"i love this game but it would be great if you could use your coins to buy fish bucks.
"
"even if it would be 10,000 coins for one fish buck, it would ma
"
"force closes wayyyy too much with new version on droid x, esp with the new event.
"
"always his issues loading too.
"
"soooooo smaallllll cant read the letters.....
"
"only issue, my events and submarine ride options have completely disappeared and i'm not happy about that.
"
"bt now the thing thats keepin me from fully enjoyin it is the money..
"
"it seems we can get coins by the bunches bt we cant get fish bucks.
"
"mostly evrythin in the store is able to be bought by fish bucks.
"
"and now i cant even play the new egyptian dive thing, it jus takes me back to my home screen.
"
"maybe its my phone bt the fish bucks needs more fixing.
"
"only downfall is when i got my new phone i lost my previous game
"
"tapfish is a nice game but when it come to the bucks i a problem since i have no i have to wait 3 day.
"
"also if you pay for bucks you only get coins when you sell.
"
"if you could earn bucks that would help.
"
"and if they got their time straight that would help too...
"
"just wish there was a way to trade in coins for fish bucks. don't like having to buy them in order to get the fish i need for trophies or challenges in breeding.
"
"should be able to earn fishbucks easier or at least make some of the fish cheaper other than that seems like a pretty long term game not bad
"
"but it force closes alot!
"
"anyone else having problems when trying to view your quests?
"
"app keeps crashing every time.
"
"enjoying playing tap fish but constant force closes on quests beginning to get frustrating.
"
"i'm changing my rating from 5 to 1 because i can't play any of the events without it up forcing me to close!
"
"wish you could convert coins to bucks, or when you buy a fish for bucks you sell it for bucks, not coins...
"
"this is the best android game i have played and the only problem is u have to pay to get fishbucks.
"
"fish die too quickly.
"
"expensive breedables but all in all, a good game.
"
"forced forecloses all the time sad because this game is awesome
"
"having issues with the game, i have not once been able to do a dive mission.
"
"game keep kicking me out every time i try.
"
"this is a fun game and the kids enjoy it too, sometimes forces close but usual runs good.
"
"i only wish that wen i accidently deleted the app wen i got it bac i didnt hav to start over
"
"just they need more free fish bucks, instead of objects not needed.
"
"i wish it wasn't so dependent on spending real money.
"
"game shuts down alot but other than that its great.
"
"way better then the exotic version, but still wish everything wasn't based off fish bucks.
"
"wish though that most of the items could be easilier purchased with just coins...
"
"sometime the program is forced to close.
"
"i only wish you could speed up breeding labs faster earn more fish bucks and have more free quests!!!
"
"third dam time this app has takin money off my account .
"
"could be easier to navigate and takes up way too much space on my phone.
"
"relies too much on premium purchases as well.
"
"best game ever i only wish i could transfer my tank from my old phone to my new phone so that i wouldn't have to start over.
"
"would give it 5 stars, but on my xperia mini pro the home button when visiting neighbours is really small, and i end up clicking objects rather than the button.
"
"the game is absolutely enthralling, only it would be nice if the in-game clock didn't run absolutely off of real time due to thr fish breeding and ageing.
"
"always want to see what mystery fish i breed, but it runs slow i have to click the wait button way too often
"
"although needing a card to purchase fish bucks or additional coins instead of putting it on the next phone bill is bummer
"
"make fish bucks easier to earn....
"
"it's cool and all but fishes are to expensive.
"
"love this game wish there was better ways to earn fish bucks though
"
"great app but the number of fishbucks is low and i wait too long to get 1 fishbuck
"
"i dont understand why we didnt have new year event for iso did thats not fair.
"
"i would give five stars if we could get the events like iso does
"
"more free fish bucks and help to restore the previous games to bring over to another phone.
"
"i love this game but needed to more option
"
"i love this app but it a bit slow. :-)
"
"love the game just wish it was a littles cheaper
"
"love it even more esp with the shorter breeding time.
"
"okay here's a idea do a pet event give a dog as a breedible and do one of the prizes a alligator please and do a gold fish in a bowl  decoration that moves if you can but if you don't like this idea you don't have to do it i just want to make tapfish a really cool game
"
"i have my tanks for two day and i like it so far, i'm waiting for more ways to make money...
"
"when i try to breed my limited breedables i get  a message that i dont have any!
"
"the only problem is it's hard to get fish bucks...
"
"i ended up with 15 watts to 8 swifty - losing 4 of them
"
"if those were easier i would play more often and i would actually buy them because i know i would be able to earn more after i blow through them so quickly because of the steep prices.
"
"i have lost a whole tank to them.
"
"only wish more fish could be purchased with coins
"
i would give it 5 star but every time play on  its some time freesy all the time.
"i love this game play it.
"
"i downloaded this game for my daughter, but i end up playing it all the time.
"
"i love it better after i updated it
"
"love this game.
"
"im hooked.

"otherwise, a good, fun game.
"
"please fix or i will be uninstalling.

"been playing over a year but the new updates screwed it up!
"
"bit annoying.....
"
"this game has been a blessing to me and her, we spend hours playing it together and she's learning a lot along the way.

"much more fun.
