",1
"wish could get fish bux easier

",1
"would someone like to explain why the frog challenge just ended a day early?
",1
"wish there were faster growing fish and that there were minigames to play to kill time
",1
"the only thing i wish is that if you can turn coins into fish bucks.
",1
"like 10,000 coins could get you 2 fish bucks and 20,000 coins could get you 5 or 6.
",1
"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
",1
"love this game but is so hard 2 earn fish bucks
",1
"but maybe have the option of buying fish bucks with the coins, something to get more and faster.
",1
"didn't get my $22 fish bucks for downloading ship wrecked!!
",1
"this game can be very fun but it takes up so i much of your time taking care of the fish!
",1
"if you don't feed them for a day all the fish die, it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
",1
"ripped off    75 bucks...
",1
"beware of this app,   when  a fish burp's  good bye to your fish bucks.
",1
"get your missing, lost or stolen fish bucks back.
",1
"and refuse to replace missing buck's.......  :(  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :'( :'(  :'( :'( :'( :'( :'(

"wish you could earn more fishbucks within the game itself, but overall its cute and easy to play.
",1
"love it just wish there were more breedable fish that didn't cost fish bucks
",1
"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
",1
"if only it was easier to get fish bucks....
",1
"great game, just wish it didn't take so long to breed the fish! 3 days is a bit much.
",1
"love it think its cool only complaint is i don't get the free fish bucks from the earn free fish bicks part
",1
"poor would not connect to the internet: (
",1
"its plays well but items ony last so long
",1
"i love the game i just wish it didn't take so long to get money
",1
"i love this game but i do wish that you could get fish buck way easier
",1
"love the game,  but it needs to have more fish you can buy with coins and less that you have to use the fishbucks for.
",1
"to complete the game will cost u more than $200.
",1
"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",1
"the only doubt is u can't get fishbucks 4 fishcash or whatever it is.
",1
"its just i ain't willing to spend money for fish money
",1
"great ggame but takes too much internet
",1
"only thing i would change are the notifications.
",1
"would rate it a 5 star but for some odd reason i can't breed any of my mystery fish so it's like if i bought them for nothing!:(
",1
"also lower the fish prizes a bit please and it will definitely be a 5 star game for me!!!:)
",1
"pass time favorite ,only dwn side is can't get fish bucks
",1
"great game can't stop playing, just wish breeding didn't take so long
",1
"this app does events all the time that make you accidentally use ""fish bucks"" which are almost impossible to earn and all the coolest stuff you have yo pay for with.
",1
"never got my 100 dollar worth fishbucks
",1
"i went to open my game an it says new bee event but nothin is there so u went to see if it needed updated an its up to date.
",1
"plus i lost 20 fish bucks during the frog event & i'm not sure how it happened.
",1
"takes way too long to breed fish though.
",1
"and it is irritating that you don't stay in the shop when buying multiple fish.
",1
"clicked on  bubble and accidentally lossed all fishbucks.
",1
"would like to get the fb back.
",1
"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
",1
"also, alot of the free buck opportunities, do.not give you.the bucks and the fish prices have become outrageous :(
",1
"i would say the only thing i dont like about it is that its hard to earn fish bucks,and alot of fish you have to buy with the fish bucks....
",1
"so i would rate this app as perfect if you were able to get free fish bucks and or earn them easier...
",1
"and twice since the update all of my fish bucks have disappeared.
",1
"i want my 20 fish bucks back
",1
"love this gane but would be great if the fish grew faster
",1
"wish there was a better to get fish bucks
",1
"its fun and is like having real fish could do with some different plants and decorations to be added on though.
",1
"needs more ""free cash & coins"", but over all very cool game.
",1
"i like the app but it wont let me buy fish so there is point keeping the app.
",1
"would like more coin fish less $ fish and the tasks given to be for coin fish not $ fish
",1
"the fish that i'm breeding for the current event are disappearing when i move them into the tank.
",1
"i would really like if i could move to another device it seems to be taking a lot of space!
",1
"just wish you could earn fish bucks faster lol
",1
"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
",1
"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
",1
"great only thing that sucks is fish buck free offers. when ya try putting in numbers it kicks you out of the offers.
",1
"easier way to get bucks
",1
"force closes alot but still love it.....
",1
"great time waster but to many fish for fish bucks i mean i have no money for fish bucks there needs to be less fish for fish bucks.
",1
"pretty easy to use and hamless unless you get greedy to have mmore coins or money.
",1
"good game but need ways to earn more fishbucks
",1
"i do like this game but i want to be able to earn fish bucks.because all the fish i like are are fish bucks for example phrina is 20 fish bucks ani only have 2.

",1
"since last update i do not have some fish.
",1
"getting free fish bucks is getting harder & harder & has not been updated in a mo. customer service is great and this fish game is way better then others.
",1
"there is another glitch w/ feeding friends  takes up alot of space i have to uninstall & re install & restore alot!
",1
"definitely need more coin fish...
",1
"is there anyway to get your game back if you switch phones??
",1
"too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
",1
"also it freezes a lot
",1

",1
"a moderately entertaining game but still requiring real money for fake fishbucks to do much of anything.
",1
"i wish all the good fish wasn't so high
",1
"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
",1
"the cost to play is too high and the software is buggy.
",1
"cost of fish bucks is unreasonable as well.
",1
"fun game, i love the variety of fish and decorations but it's so easy for your fish to die!
",1
"i enjoy playing tap fish except for how hard it is to get fish bucks.
",1
"just would like to get more bucks for doing things
",1
"i like  it but they dont give enough money or coinsand if u dont login everyday your fish die, i have a job soi cant play games everyday so they should have babysitter fish to buy for like 20 coins who freeze tank for your vacation needs
",1
"but some of the items an fish cost to much real money.
",1
"a little cluttered and slow..
",1
"only wish there was a way to retrieve deleted tanks and transfer tanks from one phone to another.
",1
"its a little slow starting out.
",1
"coins are super tight but the games pretty fun
",1
"need more ways to get fish bucks!
",1
"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
",1
"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
",1
"i love it just want more bucks rewards
",1
"slow but fun
",1
"i used to have fishlive but it crashed on me all the time.
",1
"why is tapfish disabled
",1
"forse closes allot when using certain feat.
",1
"updates killed my fish.
",1
"deffenetly 4 stars only 4 because a little hard when ur not able to play for a while
",1
"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
",1
"i liked the game,but i needed to update my phone and application did not open,sad,had to uninstall,there were no instructions how to trouble shoot.
",1
"great game but too slow
",1
"only problem is getting fish bucks to buy everything
",1
"love the game but sometime freezes
",1
"why can't we exchange coins in for fish bucks?
",1
"would have gotten 5 stars if i could of kept the game when i changed phones.
",1
"becomes addicting and sometimes it had to froce close
",1
"this game is really fun i like it exept everything cost too much
",1
"i just wish it would quit shutting dowm for no reason.
",1
"if u guys can fix that and stop wantimg so many fishbucks for things

",1
"game is ok but there should be a way to get fish bucks like so many coins = one fish buck or something
",1
"it loads and updates sooo slow!
",1
"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
",1
"won't even let me download it but rated it any way:-)
",1
"love this game only thing i'm mad about is i got a new phone and lost all my fish and could not get anything back :-(
",1
"this game is actually really fun, i wish you could get fish bucks easier though.
",1
"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
",1
"some easier way of earing bucks would be better as there are challenges that you can't meet without them.
",1
"with the recent android update, tapfish has gotten soooo slow!
",1
"i wish there were more challanges at a time.
",1
"and not so many requiring fish bucks to buy things.
",1
"just doesn't make sense to pay for fake money!
",1
"also, there are too few options for those of us who can't/won't spend tons of money on fish bucks.
",1
"aren't you making enough money through ads?
",1
"do you really want to continue trying to bore us into buying fish bucks?
",1
"im not a fan of how the majority of fish and ornaments require ""fish bucks""
",1
"it kills time but there needs to be a way to ""pause""
",1
"i downloaded shipwrecked and its been 2 days since i downloaded it and no free fish bucks are appearing in my fish bucks spot that's 22 fish bucks you owe me give them in 2days or i uninstall
",1
"accidently uninstalled reinstalled and restarted my sis went on and added me and it came up with my old 1 and all the fish dead but otherwise its great
",1
"game should save itself to my play account.
",1
"only wish you could change coins for bucks....
",1
"i updated tapfish because my phone said i had to, and the game had totally changed..
",1
"it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble..
",1
"then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
",1
"like the game, but i wish you could earn more fish bucks faster.
",1
"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
",1
"great game but hard to get fishbucks which u need to get stuff in game
",1
"takes a lot of time to level up and speed ups cost bucks.
",1
"i love playing this game i just wished i could gain levels much faster amiga...
",1
"love the game just take to long to generate cash and bucks
",1
"way too slow for my phone.
",1
"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
",1
"only one thing to make it better, a sign in.
",1
"so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
",1
"now ive lot all my prizes  that's again tap fish, you're getting deleted finally
",1
"it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
",1
"ripped off 75 bucks...
",1
"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",1
"it takes a while to load at first but its worth it!
",1
"it's fun but there isn't much to do after you clean the tank, feed and love the fish.
",1
"the bucks are impossible to earn, not enough instructions and to much waiting around for breeding to happen.
",1
"pretty cool but everything is expensive
",1
"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
",1
"i just wanna say that i love tapfish i just have one suggestion can u guys plz come up with some kind of password so that when friends who dont know what their doing grab ur phone and start messing with stuff dont sell all ur fish and mess up ur tanks.
",1
"i think there should be a way to level up faster because it takes forever trying to level up, and maybe there should also be a breedable catagory for lazy people (such as i) that way we dont have to spwnd a half hour trying to find breedable fish
",1
"really good game only bad thing is tht most of the tsks u have to have fish bucks apart from that it is good
",1
"do more batfish
",1
"can't breed new fish often cause i can't get more than 2 tanks to bread, then it takes on average 3 days to breed one fish lol.
",1
"however i wish a lot of the fish did not cost as much fish bucks as they do. its hard 2 earn enough of them in order 2 complete the tasks & it's expensive 2 buy them.
",1
"plus it is hard to get fish bucks.
",1
"love this game but i agree there should be a way to level up faster
",1
"could be a good game but is very slow & demanding of time
",1
"cute game but have to play it every day or fish will die of starvation
",1
"just wish it didn't take as long as it does to breed fish.
",1
"i don't realy like the pictures and how it's so flat and boring, but i like the huge the selection of fish.
",1
"the game is pretty fun jusr wish that the fish bucks were easier to get and everything was cheaper but overall p0retty fun i would recomend it also wish the fish didn't die so fast
",1
"fun game but super hard to earn fishbucks
",1
"enjoyable game,,,slow to start though.
",1
"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
",1
"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks w/o having to buy them or download so many other apps.
",1
"love the game but not 5 stars because the fish die way to fast
",1
"love this game but i wish you could get more fish bucks for free.
",1
"boring and stupid because you need lots of money to buy things and they barely give u any
",1
"it's fun just long and alot of things you need fish bucks for but you barely get them for free
",1
"for 2 days and now it won't open any more
",1
"i wish i never updated my tap fish game i used to be able to buy puffer fish that would bring in the $$ but not any more.
",1
"i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks to get all of the crazy fishies!
",1
"only complaint it takes a few seconds to load.
",1
"i love to play, but you need to spend lots of money to get fish to breed.
",1
"needs more fish and new fish.
",1
"could go a bit faster though
",1
"you can't do much without fish bucks and they cost $.
",1
"game shuts down alot but other than that its great.
",1
"stupid game give my more fish bucks
",1
"hard to obtain fish bucks.
",1
"great game, but needs more fish for higher levels.
",1
"i'm level 54 and there is nothing for several more levels.
",1
"like alot, love fish, dont like 2 spend real money or have 2 download stuff u dont want just 2 get more bucks or coins.
",1
"needs fake money 2 spend.
",1
"takes to long to level up and most quests take $ to complete!
",1
"it doesn't give u hardly any coins for tending to ur fish!
",1
"however, it takes way too long to earn bucks.
",1
"the challenges are fun at first but then it gets old.
",1
"it constantly asks to buy more bucks.
",1
"there should be an option to exchange coins for bucks.
",1
"4/5 hard go get fish bucks but fun
",1
"there should be an easier way to get bucks. how 'bout every 500 coins you get you get one?
",1
"that way people can revive their fish without having to pay as often.
",1
"i got a new phone and    now i cannot get back into the game that i have   spent so much money on i have been well over $1000.00 and it's a shame to lose everything that i just built up.
",1
"i paid money to remove ads and i still got them
",1
"but should have a way of buying fish bucks using your coins.
",1
"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
",1
"very good game, some lagging but that might just be my phone.
",1
"a little cluttered and slow.
",1
"also alot of focus on fish bucks, which are hard to get without buying them.
",1
"i wish there was more way to earn fish bucks.
",1
"this last update stole millions of coins from my tank not to mention all the bs with the frog event.
",1
"the only downfall is hard to get fish bucks without buying them.
",1
"maybe trading coins for bucks or awarding more bucks when leveling up.
",1
"would rate higher but to obtain breeder fish and other things you need to pay2play and i just can't offord it.
",1
"dislike bubble tips and smiley faces on feed fish.
",1
"it is very fun but make it a little more interactive with the fish
",1
"i wish they could put in a permanet mini game to get fish bucks,coins,fish or decorations ethre
",1
"its a cool game but its stupid you can progress if u don't have bucks wilhich u need credit card for
",1
"it'll glitch everytime i go to play store then exit it and click the game itself on the phone it just goes right back to play store
",1
"not giving all fishbucks when you download games also when foggy event was over did not receive breedable frog did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable froggy
",1
"it does take an awfully long time to level up,  and it's unfortunate that so many basic things can only be bought with ""fish bucks"" which are very difficult to earn many of without paying money.
",1
"and many quests require you to buy these things.
",1
"i just wish you could advance up quicker yeah you can speed up your fish eggs to hatch.
",1
"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
",1
"it won't let me connect to the server. i report it every time but it is always the same thing.
",1
"won't let me participate in the easter event.
",1
"every time i catch the fish, it says ""image not found""
",1
"i love it (but why will they make the decoration's and every thing so much you can just get a fish with that money and fish buck's
",1
"i 'v played this app before it crashs alot but i'm giving it a second chance if it did not crash i would have this app forevef
",1
"its fun except every thing needs fishbucks
",1
"love this game but very disappointed with the adds that pop up!
",1
"you should monitor what's advertised.
",1
"hate waiting but great
",1
"takes a while to load but it already filled the last two hours of fun
",1
"it would be better if the game will allow me and my phone not to be on the internet all the time and still be this fun & cool!
",1
"good but the good fish cost fish bucks which you have to buy with real money and the fish are way to expensive.
",1
"it also take way to long to level up.
",1
"can't breed the fish i want.
",1
"fish bucks are too much!
",1
"thank you tap fish makers but please have more games to earn fish bucks !
",1
"wish it didn't take so long to breed special event fish.
",1
"after the update the bubble icon is taking a lot of time this game is entertaining but it must be fast so to be fast please remove bubble icon
",1
"i also love the breeding just wish it didnt take  do long to breed!
",1
"the only thing i don't like is that if you miss the deadline on an event cuz of work or anything there is no extension.
",1
"changed phones and lost everything which stinks.
",1
"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
",1
"only wish fish bucks were easier to come by
",1
"there needs to be a way to transfer my game to another phone.
",1
"spenf a lot if time and money on this then got a new phone and am having to start over!
",1
"ive switched phones, downloaded tap fish and i have to start all over again i believe i had pleanty more fish than the 2 i have now and my fish bucks are gone how do i get my fish tanks back.?
",1
"or be able to buy more with coins.
",1
"all the fish's eggs should be displayed under one head, instead of various categories and also the selling star rating should be displayed
",1
"takes too long to move up levels though
",1
"great app try to purchase fish bucks though other apps but, still waiting the only bad thing
",1
"but i do think a 12 hr breeding time for a total of 90 fish to breed is a bit long for shorter event time.
",1
"im in love with this game, but fish bucks need to go i hate that.
",1
"live wallpaper needs to be fixed also : (
",1
"the new event is not giving me the prize when i bred my fish and 11 hours thats a little to long to be able to get everything.
",1
"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
",1
"changed from 5 stars because the new valentines event takes 12hrs to breed and 6 days to complete.
",1
"this game is so  fun except tht the baby fish take for ever to grow
",1
"i like the game save ur bucks their hard to come by seem like they want u 2 use cash to advance other than that good game
",1
"i like the events, but sometimes it kind of stinks when you don't have the fish bucks for them.
",1
"and you really don't have good deals for fish bucks.
",1
"love this game, but i wish there was an easier way to transfer game from one phone to the next.
",1
"never succewd open even the internet connection available and in a hi speed wifi.
",1
"this game takes up the most space on my phone.
",1
"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
",1
"the graphics and fonts overlap!
",1
"but wish the fish weren't so expensive or cost so many fish bucks
",1
"i love playing tapfish and wanna thank u for retrieving the coins i couldn't get but i really wish i wouldn't of lost all my tanks and all the work i had in this game for the past yr i lost a lot of tanks and fish that took days to earn and the money spent while i played .but i had to get a replacement phone ,same phone just wish i wouldst of lost all that i worked hard for should be a way to not loose games that would b awesome !
",1
"i want alot of fish bucks for free please
",1
"game not bad, but you start off slow.
",1
"wish there was an easier way to get coins and cash.
",1
"joys of fun only downfalls is it takes forever to level up and fish cost way to much fish bucks.
",1
"not easy trying to earn fish bucks without actually spending real money.
",1
"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
",1
"it is very show moving store to i don't want to spend real money to get fish bucks.
",1
"it takes a long time to accumulate bucks to buy things or to speed up the breeding process.
",1
"i just wished that i could earn fish bucks faster
",1
"need more fish bucks free!
",1
"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
",1
"good game but constantly crashes.!
",1
"cool just wish you got fish bucks often
",1
"i still can't breed mystery fish.
",1
"ilove this game and so does my 3 yr old grandson he always asks gamma can i play fish with you only problem is when i changed phones i lost it all but it is fun rebuilding

"it only lets me breed 2 fish in the mystery breeds.

"this is a great game but certain functions like cleaning the tank don't work well on a phone...
",1
"with a few adjustments like making it easier to get cash and coins as well as the cleaning problem this would be an amazing game
",1
"the only downside is that more than half the fish are only available thru in-game purchase of fishbucks.

"the fish cost to much and they made up half the fishes names
",1
"i love the breeding events the best though, don't really like the submarine ones :/

"it is slower and the fish and decorations are smaller but tapfish keeps improving it so hopefully soon it is just as good as the iphone version.

"last quest had a ridiculous amount of monsters
",1
"crashes a lot but still worth it
",1
"this game for me right now is a four star game, but if they lower the fish prices and if sometimes they would also give you fish bucks when you sell a fish, it will totally be a five start game!!:)
