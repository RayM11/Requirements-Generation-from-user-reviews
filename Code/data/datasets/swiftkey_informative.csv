Review,Relevant
"And I want swift key to save the words I type.
",1
"I think it could do with a bit more customization...
",1
"And a few more settings for example, after I insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after..It would be good to be able to turn that off.
",1
"Also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
",1
"I really would like to see Chinese language integration to be developed.
",1
"Very annoying to switch with other input methods.
",1
"Does not work with S-Pen on Galaxy Note 2
",1
"I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
",1
"Last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
",1
"Used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
",1
"It WAS awesome until the layout was changed.
",1
"It may work for large displays but NOT phones with cases on them!
",1
"I hate the new slide punctuation bar!
",1
"Bring smaller space bar back!
",1
"You need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database. This way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!!!
",1
"When your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open SwiftKey.
",1
"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",1
"Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
",1
"Im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for Chinese either,  over rated.
",1
"Wish I could customize the layout, then I would give 5 stars.
",1
"Awesome keyboard just lags with Google takes forever to show up.
",1
"I like how you did pumpkin for Halloween can we get a Christmas theme.
",1
"Because of missing of Macedonian language!
",1
"Ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work..
",1
"I also don't like that you can't use swear words.
",1
"I'm 23, please let me use what words I want to use.
",1
"I am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
",1
"Swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.
",1
"I find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
",1
"I have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
",1
"Also, I should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
",1
"It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
",1
"If this language/font were to be added, SwiftKey would win the award for best Android app.
",1
"After having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
",1
"But very glitchy on Google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key...
",1
"Only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
",1
"Very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
",1
"Always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
",1
"Until I updated to Jelly Bean, I would give this app 5 stars.
",1
"However, following the update on my S3 to Jelly Bean, it now reverts to the Samsung keyboard as the default every time I restart the phone.
",1
"From my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until Jelly Bean is updated to 4.1.2.
",1
"I just need Chinese!!!
",1
"Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
",1
"Keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too...
",1
"Just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
",1
"As stated before SwiftKey does not load after a reboot. It has to be disabled an re enable again.
",1
"Great keyboard and prediction but needs SWIPE function for portrait mode and better customization
",1
"Update: Using on the LG Optimus G and the cursor KEEPS  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
",1
"But can't personalized with fb..
",1
"Uninstalled until I can save it to the SD card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
",1
"This app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my GS3
",1
"Give me a red version of the ""holo"" theme and you'll get 5 stars.
",1
"The only thing I do hate is when I enter a full stop then  space it automatically In puts (I) so my sentences start with I when I'm typing fast.
",1
"Used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my GS3 it will not hold as default :'-(
",1
"I would love to more themes, the current themes are great but I love customising my phone.
",1
"Wheres the clipboard button?
",1
"This auto correct is illogical sometimes.
",1
"When I type ""just""  I don't mean ""justified"".
",1
"It will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
",1
"Was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my Samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!!
",1
"I don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a Samsung galaxy tablet 10.1
",1
"Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
",1
"Please add a few themes frequently.
",1
"I love this keyboard,  but I notice a significant decrease in my battery life when I use it.
",1
"It would be perfect if there was a delete key!
",1
"I would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
",1
"As it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
",1
"Love it but needs emoji support now
",1
"Pretty good,  I get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what I actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
",1
"Just wish it had more themes.
",1
"One like Holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
",1
"Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
",1
"I love this app best $3 I've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
",1
"The one and only problem I have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
",1
"I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
",1
"This app is okay except that the keys are loud when I type, so if I'm working or hunting I have to change the settings.
",1
"And if I'm just not finding how to change the setting I apologize but I've looked everywhere on the phone
",1
"Needs more themes!
",1
"Love the "".com""  button but I wish it were in a different place. Maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
",1
"You need more themes..
",1
"It's a great keyboard,  I just get board with the limited options
",1
"It's useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard.
",1
"In the Dvorak layout, the lowercase 'M' & 'W' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press. The 'W' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
",1
"This would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the ""com"" button while in a browser renders it nearly useless. Hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
",1
"I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
",1
"I the only reason I give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
",1
"Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
",1
"Just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient...
",1
"1 - The keyboard reverts to the original Android Keyboard every time the USB storage becomes disconnected.
",1
"Every time I hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, I have to re-enable it via the Android OS Settings.
",1
"Great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
",1
"Numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
",1
"I don't need it suggesting an odometer reading I'll never see again.
",1
"It would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
",1
"But could you guys add a swiping option?
",1
"If I take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
",1
"Needs improvement in Arabic language support
",1
"My only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most Samsung galaxy s3
",1
"The only weird thing I encountered was on my RAZR while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
",1
"Amazing app, although I wish there were more themes to choose from.
",1
"It doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
",1
"An example is when you type something on Google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
",1
"The same happens in some contact names fields such as Gmail, GOSMS Pro, Any.do. Etc.
",1
"I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text...like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3 and way more Update;
",1
"giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
",1
"whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
",1
"i have tried to ask if possible to add ""numbers"" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog... but no one answer, nobody care...
",1
"I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language...
",1
"I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
",1
"This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
",1
"Just at least one of all the major colors. ESPECIALLY RED!
",1
"Please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
",1
"It always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, I wish I hadn't paid for this before I knew there was a free version
",1
"Have turned off as does not support pen entered text on Samsung note 2.
",1
"Have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
",1
"If you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
",1
"I want more color fonts
",1
"Why is there no Tab key?
",1
"But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
",1
"I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The only complaint I do have are a couple of bugs.
",1
"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",1
"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
",1
"It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",1
"Fatal support for Polish.
",1
"I really dislike how it fails to show predictions during Web browser use.
",1
"There are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
",1
"Totally annoying when I'm used to typing as best I can and picking predictions from the list. At least please give us the option to turn it on / off.
",1
"The only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
",1
"Great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
",1
"However, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
",1
"It's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type URLs into text messages.
",1
"The only thing I really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
",1
"I'm used to typing correctly in the first place so I add the space myself and SwiftKey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
",1
"I want to turn predictions completely OFF, but can't?
",1
"5 stars if could turn off predictions.
",1
"I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
",1
"Just add emojis and more themes.
",1
"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",1
"Would like S Pen support for Galaxy Note 2 so I don't have to swap when writing documents.
",1
"But the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the Samsung at all..
",1
"And when I'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.. It hits the. com
",1
"Whenever I try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together... Why is that?
",1
"Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
",1
"Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
",1
"Emoji support.
",1
"Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
",1
"This keyboard is amazing but the only problem I have with it is that when I use Google drive it slows down and lags SO much.
",1
"I just wish they would add swipe
",1
"Would like to see a couple more themes, but I have no complaints as the Holo theme is gorgeous.
",1
"I think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram..
",1
"A ridiculous amount of RAM!
",1
"Please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by Google for nexus.
",1
"When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
",1
"Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
",1
"Loved Swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
",1
"A lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
",1
"The app also has trouble downloading the language packs ...
",1
"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",1
"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",1
"Love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my S3
",1
"But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
",1
"Edit: The keyboard stop predicting when I am in Any.do, Facebook web browser and several other applications that I couldn't remember.
",1
"Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
",1
"However,  every time I close all apps and ram memory and I go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with SwiftKey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
",1
"Long story short I have to go change the options to have SwiftKey on every time I want to text.
",1
"Suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
",1
"I wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme For your phone.
",1
"Won't start automatically on GS3 however.
",1
"But it is not compatible with 4.1.1  So frustrated.
",1
"Split keyboard does NOT work on the Note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
",1
"I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
",1
"The keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
",1
"Most notably Google now.... it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
",1
"I wish there will be more themes added
",1
"Please integrate swype.
",1
"Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
",1
"Prediction does not work anymore.
",1
"I only wish they had more color scheme.
",1
"With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
",1
"I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
",1
"I was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did NOT import.
",1
"The settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
",1
"Very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
",1
"Since I updated my S3 to Kelly Bean sometimes SwiftKey is not even activating when I go to text or type.
",1
"I have to exit whatever I'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as I said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ICS.
",1
"I love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when I I'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service I thought it was my phone but now I have the note 2 n same thing..
",1
"I just hate how when I click the 123 icon on the keyboard I hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular S3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
",1
"5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
",1
"I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
",1
"I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
",1
"Would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
",1
"Drawback, could do with more skins.
",1
"Great keyboard only issue I have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so I have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
",1
"Was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects...
",1
"Feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work...
",1
"Can't go without this keyboard anymore, though I'd still love to be able to disable gestures
",1
"It does occasionally stop typing.
",1
"Kinda laggy when opening and closing..
",1
"Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
",1
"The Arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
",1
"Can't remember my email address.
",1
"Has a problem remembering simple words.
",1
"Please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
",1
"I used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
",1
"Namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
",1
"Pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
",1
"Sometimes word prediction doesn't show up. Have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
",1
"really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
",1
"I would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
",1
"I have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
",1
"English, of course, but with Korea prediction and everything?
",1
"The beta edition for Thai has been expired. Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
",1
"My only flaw is since the jelly bean update if I have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
",1
"It works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
",1
"something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
",1
"But I would love a cleaner looking interface.
",1
"Would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
",1
"Frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
",1
"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",1
"Resets after boot or restart.
",1
"Will not set itself as default keyboard.
",1
"I recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been HORRIBLE.
",1
"The keyboard is horribly laggy.
",1
"I've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
",1
"Only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
",1
"Only complaint: no swype mode.
",1
"Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
",1
"Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
",1
"Due to error 941 this is bs. Cannot refund either
",1
"Wouldn't install on my gs3
",1
"I just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
",1
"It does not install. Error 941
",1
"I enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words I put in.
",1
"And I'd like to see more, newer themes.
",1
"The only thing that I can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
",1
"I just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
",1
"Bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
",1
"Every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
",1
"As mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
",1
"I sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
",1
"They updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly. How about a few more?
",1
"It would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
",1
"Developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
",1
"I would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
",1
"But after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
",1
"But since I root my phone, I constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
",1
"It feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
",1
"I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
",1
"The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
",1
"Best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
",1
"Amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
",1
"Predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
",1
"Spell check randomly stops working.
",1
"Prediction will sometimes turn off when I sleep the phone.
",1
"Need S-Pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
",1
"Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
",1
"If you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, I will give you 5 stars.
",1
"The back-spacing on the keyboard is a bit slow. I wish I could adjust it.
",1
"This work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until I pull the battery
",1
"Just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
",1
"Just add swype pleeease
",1
"Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is I can not use swype as on the Samsung keyboard.
",1
"SK3 was working flawlessly until the AT&T JB update for S3 recently came out.
",1
"When locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
",1
"Also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.
",1
"Will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
",1
"I would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys. And when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
",1
"I've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the Samsung keyboard.
",1
"(I still hope for some hearts :D)
",1
"I do wish it supported Japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
",1
"Plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
",1
"Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
",1
"C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
",1
"It doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
",1
"Would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
",1
"atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, I'd really like a quieter option!
",1
"wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
",1
"Used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the Swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with Android jelly bean.
",1
"As much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone. Crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
",1
"But I wish it used less memory!
",1
"The word ""it's"" is almost impossible and always comes out as ""is"".
",1
"Also could you allow use of could words?
",1
"Please integrate learning from WhatsApp Messenger as well.
",1
"At the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
",1
"Sometimes wish it had more themes though.
",1
"Only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
",1
"However the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
",1
"Often times when I hit the ""A"" key I hit the shift key.
",1
"I can't download the language pack. It's the same error over and over again.
",1
"Good app but the Turkish dictionary is very insufficient. It doesn't contain many basic words.
",1
"I request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, Google and Facebook.
",1
"Suggested words were never accurate either.
",1
"It's good but I'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
",1
"The best,no s-pen detection?
",1
"where is handwriting for s pen?
",1
"My only issue with this and it's a SERIOUS issue with me is that since I got the update for my S III to 4.1 is that I can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when I type. The phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what I do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
",1
"would love more themes!
",1
"But, it's been almost a year and I think one new theme was added!
",1
"Come on guys... Get on board the theme wagon!
",1
"Would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
",1
"This by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to JB, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
",1
"As mentioned by others, Google search has slowed with the keyboard not appearing for several seconds when using this keyboard.
",1
"I have had this keyboard since I first got the Evo, I just love it, I wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!
",1
"SwiftKey please add: Swipe, personal dictionary and prediction for email and name.
",1
"Not working with jelly bean
",1
"Some of the predictive text functions are annoying but its a good app otherwise.
",1
"Pleeeaassseee come out with more themes....
",1
"I'd still like an editable dictionary of the words that it has learned.
",1
"Closes while I type.
",1
"Puts in wrong words when I have the right words and completely omits words when I type too fast.
",1
"Oh and the voice recognition of voice to text barely works.
",1
"After updating to jb, there is no heptic intensity control. It's always full blast.
",1
"But i don't like keyboard skin model, if you can make keyboard skin like original keyboard, itu Will great
",1
"Just updated my AT&T galaxy s3 from os 4.0.4 to the new 4.1.1 jelly bean and my paid version of swift key 3 no longer works and keeps force closing fix this please??
",1

"swiftkey is really a good keyboard.. but not perfect for me, hope can improve by adding chinese language.
",1
"besides, slide to delete not so sensitive, hope can improve
",1
"Updated to Jelly Bean. I have all haptic feedback turned off on my phone, but after the update it has been turned back on only using SwiftKey.
",1
"It's draining my battery.
",1
"My phone stoped responding While using the keyboard seince recent update.
",1
"Just improve the polish and french dict. :-)
",1
"This keyboard was stunning on my old Galaxy Ace2 but I now use Galaxy S3 mini running Jelly Bean 4.1 and now Swiftkey will not work.
",1
"The keyboard refuses to pop-up when i require to type ( in all apps including txt, kingsoft office, WhatsApp log-in's etc) and I hve to revert to the Samsung keyboard.
",1
"Regretably had to un-install.
",1
"The swipe down gesture to minimize the keyboard doesn't work very well.
",1
"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",1
"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",1
"we need more themes!! like a red and green one for Christmas!!
",1
"or color personalization
",1
"Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!!
",1
"And I don't want to type in landscape.
",1
"Autocorrect no longer works since they put out swiftkey flow.
",1
"Have noticed a bug with it though (although not sure if this is a bug with the keyboard or with android), whenever my phone runs out of battery or I restart it for any reason, the keyboard defaults to Samsung Keyboard.
",1
"After turning on phone keyboard does not load. Have to go into settings and choose again.
",1
"It misses the hinglish language support.
",1
"It still lags on viber but over all it is amazing but yeah when is SwiftKey Flow coming to this app or making a new one the is the flow version??
",1
"Issue 1: I don't use smileys!! Please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
",1
"Issue 2: Alt keys layout. Couldn't you just set it out like EVERY OTHER KEYBOARD ON THE MARKET!?
",1
"I want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  I want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen. At least give the option to your users.
",1
"This keyboard is amazing for English but it doesn't have a Japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
",1
"The only 'complaint' is that the themes are quite awful.
",1
"When I'm on Facebook I only get the keyboard. No auto correct or word - guess - er.
",1
"Also when I finish a word at the end of a line I can't insert a space bar??
",1
"I love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the Chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
",1
"Slow to minimize on JB Maxx HD update, the functionality however destroys ics/jb keyboard.
",1
"Awesome keyboard needs more haptic feedback and it will be perfect.
",1
"Waiting for chinese support, it's amazing to try this kind of input.
",1
"It would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
",1
"Can you add traditional Chinese?
",1
"The keyboard is now running slow, freezes  takes a while to open and close...
",1
"I love everything about the app except for one thing, I wish there were more theme options.
",1
"I have a galaxy note and the swiping feature doesn't work..
",1
"Love the keyboard but its really slow now
",1
"When I changed it back to the samsung galaxy keyboard it stopped.
",1
"The only complaint is have is that there isn't a customized dictionary.
",1
"It doesn't predict words I use all the time
",1
"Pls update thai language im waiting for the long time
",1
"I deducted one star, however, because it causes crashes with some regularity.
",1
"Needs another simultaneous dictionary.
",1
"Annoying censorship.
",1
"I can understand censoring explicit swearing but words like ""gay"", ""horny"" or ""sex"" get changed into something else.
",1
"""Erection"" gets go changed into ""election"" although the letters aren't even near.
",1
"Also, apparently, dictionaries not too complete.
",1
"""Egyptian"" doesn't exist.
",1
"Writing in Portuguese is a pain.
",1
"since the update when i type, it puts random periods and wrong text.
",1
"I get an error message when I try to install the language pack that says there is a problem with the network connection, make sure your network connection is working, then try again.
",1
"I think the problem may be that this new version of the Note is running Jelly Bean.
",1
"I see that some others running Jelly Bean are also experiencing problems.
",1
"If got Chinese input I will give you 5 star.
",1
"Hope faster get Chinese input!!
",1
"Were need Chinese input!!!
",1
"Normal typing just doesn't cut it any more.
",1
"Normally I would give it only four stars because there are still a few very minor bugs that need ironing out from a power user perspective, but this app is one of the key selling points for Android, in my opinion.
",1
"Why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button? With a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.
",1
"Why does it learn from everything except whatsapp?
",1
"The keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
",1
"Other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, I like my S3 stock keyboard layout more.
",1
"Back to 3 stars until they add an option to disable the key popup !!!
",1
"My only slight annoyance is when the "".com"" key appears. I wish there was an option to hide it, I seem to press it on accident often.
",1
"Also, why does SwiftKey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
",1
"After upgrading to Jelly Bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed...
",1
"I purchased this app because it simply awesome but after I movedto jellybean it'sshowing error crashes and copy and paste optionsare disabled.
",1
"More themes..?
",1
"Works perfect but for some reason it lags when I exit the typing mode.
",1
"Only thing is that if you screw up the last word of a text message and hit send it doesn't fix that last word before sending..
",1
"Please make it fix the last word when we hit send.....
",1
"Could use an update for better keys on 7 inch tablets  Like my nexus 7
",1
"Im one of those people who depend on auto correct and it never works.
",1
"Good keyboard but ''percentage'' symbol missing and not very good performance...
",1
"Thanks forbalways adding words when i hit the space bar and for always learning the wrong way to spell words.
",1
"Would love to see more themes though!
",1
"but no compact QWERTY option which I think is essential in portrait view
",1
"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",1
"Resets after boot or restart.
",1
"more themes would be appreciated dev.
",1
"Please please please revert back to a seperate ""!"" button like in the old version of swiftkey.
",1
"I press ""!"" ""?"" and ""."" way more often than the letter ""q"". It deserves its own place. 1 button for 3 common keys?
",1
"BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR ""!"" AND ""?""!!!
",1
"One thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as I am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes I prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
",1
"The only thing I would add is more customisation options!
",1
"This app is very good w/ English  But Arabic layout is very annoying, Please use Windows layout instead of MAC
",1
"But why does it take up 27 MB of RAM on my Galaxy Nexus?
",1
"The more RAM programs use the less program you can run EFFICIENTLY, slowing down the phone in general.
",1
"Often I notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up RAM for no reason and have to uninstall the Hogs. This is similar to the memory leak problem Firefox has on the desktop.
",1
"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",1
"Arabic letters are rather small
",1
"but uses good amount of ram in background.
",1
"It's a decent keyboard replacement but I feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
",1
"For example typing lowercase free standing ""i"" isn't auto capitalized, typing ""whats"" isn't auto corrected to ""what's"" and so on.
",1
"It also takes a lot of memory.
",1
"Sometimes its a bit freaky how predictable this is.
",1
"Just wish it had more themes.
",1
"But frequently it does weird things when trying to type on the Web.
",1
"(Dolphin) Frequently when entering text in a field it repeats the first key press instead of typing the letters I am pressing.
",1
"Best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
",1
"It would be nice if it had some options to take advantage of the huge screens that are coming out.
",1
"Good but please have a save to see card option I payed 4 bucks for this and I takes up a lot of space.
",1
"But would like to see more colors please!
",1
"this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of ram
",1
"Jelly Bean resets Swiftkey when the phone is restarted.
",1
"Any chance to add Chinese language?
",1
"Just wish you could swipe also
",1
"Main problem prediction (lithuanian).
",1
"Would be more stars if there was possibility to turn off the prediction.
",1
"Now it seems to be making up its own words and not correct anything even when I have cleared the language data.
",1
"It needs a number row like the stock note keyboard
",1
"When I use this keyboard on my gs3 it is very unresponsive and laggy.
",1
"Only complaint is the amount of RAM needed and the delay that occurs when closing the keyboard after hitting the home button.
",1
"I will support you if you add support for Japanese language.
",1
"It kinda annoys me that it has persian (who in the world speaks persian) and not such a widely known language as Japanese.
",1
"More themes please.
",1
"Only request is for a collapse keyboard button. Sometimes buttons like that are just needed.
",1
"Time for more themes thank u
",1
"Love it, all it needs is more themes.
",1
"I'll give 5 stars when the Jellybean issue is fixed.
",1
"I want to see performance increased for the Samsung Galaxy S3.
",1
"All the app really lacks is more themes.
",1
"Good keyboard but, can we disable the prediction?
",1
"Once the swype features are added it'll be unrivalled!
",1
"Just wish you had more themes or ability to make a custom theme.
",1
"I dont know what the dev thought when he decided to ask for email and facebook access (major security concern).
",1
"The app is supposed to allow y to delete mistaken words you don't want in the language model.
",1
"I press and hold the prediction, and there is no option to delete! It's really annoying because common typos then become predictions
",1
"After reboot im locked back into the Samsung keyboard, help me it is already set for default
",1
"But the only downside is that since jellybean update its constantly ""forget"" the default keyboard selection...
",1
"Overall product quality is very good except it's user defined library doesn't work with whatsapp.
",1
"Because of whatsapp issue I can just give 3 stars...
",1
"My only concern is that when entering emails the app needs to recognize that you are doing so and needs to adjust accordingly (eithout automatically spacing after periods, auto capatilizing letters for certain email addresses).
",1
"But really bad performance on 4.1.
",1
"Hangs often and really slow button response.
",1
"The only issue I have is that it is slow to start up at times in most apps.
",1
"Please fix the slow start up times and this is a perfect keyboard!
",1
"I love this keyboard but have started having an issue after upgrade to Jelly Bean.
",1
"The Predictions row gets turned off each time I wake the screen if the keyboard was open when the screen goes to sleep.
",1
"If I close the keyboard and reopen, predictions come back.
",1
"Let's get some more themes now! ;-)
",1
"but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
",1
"add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
",1
"Certainly the best for typing, the only thing I would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
",1
"As petty as it sounds I would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
",1
"All we need is Chinese input (I prefer strokes)
",1
"No word prediction in various browsers.
",1
"No dedicated # row option either.
",1
"If only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
",1
"It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
",1
"But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
",1
"SwiftKey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a Chinese input..
",1
"1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app
",1
"If they could integrate a bit of slide like FlexT9 it would be unbeatable.
",1
"Auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
",1
"Can't even get it for the default browser.
",1
"Also, when I have the keyboard enabled, it for some reason disables the handwriting feature in the Samsung Keyboard for the Note 2
",1
"I like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
",1
"More themes!
",1
"I can download any language except for English.
",1
"**still not saving any new words!!
",1
"Seems to have totally forgotten a lot of my saved words.
",1
"Also if I type too fast it just deletes the word and I have to type it again.
",1
"Changed to three stars because it loves the battery.
",1
"Cut my S III's battery time almost in half.
",1
"PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
",1
"EXELENT BUT NO WWW
",1
"My only gripe is that when I hit close to the 'i'  key I sometimes hit the 'u' key instead,  and i never use u for you so this bothers me.
",1
"It doesn't support one hand operation which is so essential for the giant screen of Note 2.
",1
"I use the swipe on android and this keyboard  dont have it
",1
"I don't like how laggy it can be sometimes.
",1
"It is especially bad when I switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
",1
"I also have speed issues when I'm touch typing like I would on the normal android keyboard.
",1
"But PLEASE add swipe right as a redo. (swipe left deletes a word,  so swipe left undoes that deletion).
",1
"I often find myself accidentally deleting words...
",1
"Its take so much time for pop up and its typing speed is slow
",1
"The predictions don't show up and it won't auto correct my words.
",1
"My version has a few misspelled words that it automatically displays in the predictions window. Cannot edit the dictionary to remove them.
",1
"SmartSpace is terrible, unadjustable, and too invasive.
",1
"FYI: SwiftKey doesn't like the Moto LapDock at all.
",1
"Certain behaviors like automatic spacing after periods are a pain in the @$$ when trying to type in my email address that has periods in it.
",1
"An option that disables automatic spacing after punctuation is necessary.
",1
"I would also like to see an option to edit the personal dictionary.
",1
"Its a great keyboard however I wish it suppoerted the samsung swipe.
",1
"As mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
",1
"Bug: when typing words beginning with a capital letter on Firefox, that word won't be written
",1
"And plz provide new themes.
",1
"Sometimes the auto predict won't even come up when you're texting/typing.
",1
"Some of the minor problems I have with it are the fact that the keyboard wants to insert an I if you hit enter after a period.
",1
"I like the fact that it can predict my words but I rarely start a sentence with I.
",1
"Also some of the words it will allow me to type and won't correct are some of the most mispelled words, although there are only a handful and the keyboard will learn which words you use and don't.
",1
"I love this keyboard, but since updating to 4.2.1, I've got performance issues.
",1
"First, the keyboard takes too long to show up  second, the keyboard lags when typing rapidly (it used to be buttery smooth).
",1
"Would have been great to receive the incompatibility warning PRIOR to paying.
",1
"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
",1
"It keeps inserting words I don't want.
",1
"Limited dictionary.
",1
"Costs me way more effort than the std keyboard because I have to go back constantly to correct.
",1
"Just little niggles like not working correctly in Chrome like user name and captchas.
",1
"Emoji support would be awesome please.
",1
"This is an outstanding app and I would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) Swipe functionality and (2) More keyboard themes.
",1
"The current set of themes lack the look and feel.
",1
"Keeps saying it saved me 10,000 keystroke but it doesnt take into account the 50,000 it missed.
",1
"Doesnt even put an apostrophe on the doesnt in this critique.
",1
"Just lacking the ! shortcut now.
",1
"I can't fix typos often when I already have typed other words.
",1
"I'll go back to fix it and when I press the backspace button, it adds chucks of words instead of erasing.
",1
"Also, when typing in all capitals, the auto correct is very bad. Especially the first one.
",1
"Rarely has a hiccup, but some keys I'd rather have on the main board.
",1
"Speaking of which though, I wish there was Japanese and Chinese available so I don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
",1
"Please add more themes
",1
"Great app but you lose the ability to add standard Samsung characters, like the hearts for example.
",1
"Also no personal dictionary.
",1
"What about being able to learn from whatsapp as I do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
",1
"We also need Italian keyboard layout
",1
"I gave it a 4 because I thought it would have more color customization.
",1
"Need Thai language
",1
"Dude where are the themes!??
",1
"When I just had the trial version the app worked like a charm but now it freezes from time to time for no apparent reason.
",1
"I am forced to exit the program and start over from the beginning-sending emails is even worse - in landscape view it is almost impossible to see what you are writing
",1
"Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that we can't type in Chinese!!!
",1
"I mean, there's even languages I have never heard of, but not Chinese mandarin...oh and another, at times it doesn't automatically autocorrect and a word such as ""gjakdn"" will pass
",1
"Tle letter for arabic keyboard is small very difficult to write
",1
"Only thing I'd change is more theme options
",1
"After my Galaxy Nexus got updated to 4.2, the keyboard was gone.Not just gone as default keyboard, but removed uninstalled.
",1
"The basic s-pen function is not there and you have to revert back to the basic android application.
",1
"I commonly have the problem that it will not do predictions in landscape mode.
",1
"Need a button to toggle predictions.
",1
"Now it's just like any other keyboard, not keeping my regularly used terms in its dictionary.
",1
"It's lacking customisation to make it efficient enough to compete with Swype which makes touch typing feel like swimming.
",1
"The auto correction is totally busted(makes you write like a retard)
",1
"The setup is overly complicated and confusing.
",1
"Please add a vibrate setting like the stock Android keyboard.
",1
"I have noticed that the standard Samsung keyboard method will come back every now and then and I have to swipe to get the notification center and change back to ""SwiftKey 3"" from ""Samsung keyboard"" on my Galaxy S3. It will happen every time I restart the phone and then try to text or anything else.
",1
"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",1
"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook. It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",1
"The only problem I have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating -
",1
"It doesnt work with fb chat... which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
",1
"the only improvement that SwiftKey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the Samsung keyboard and hold the 123? Button to paste.
",1
"The keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much...
",1
"If I just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email...
",1
"There is a ton if lag!
",1
"I start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and I've already written a paragraph.
",1
"Eats a ton of RAM.
",1
"Major issues with Chrome fields.... Jumps all over the place, erases characters.
",1
"Personally I find I type less accurately with this keyboard than the stock one.
",1
"Also don't like the numbers/characters panel.
",1
"The option to have a more classic looking one wouldn't go amiss.
",1
"Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
",1
"I posted a review telling that on Samsung Galaxy Note doesn't work very well, it keeps crashing and freezing my messaging app and whatsapp.
",1
"Sometimes I have to wait MINETES till I can use it again.
",1
"I can't stand not having a dedicated '?' key.
",1
"And speed but every update resets my personal word info.
",1
"Please allow a backup and give us the option to ADD our own words with priority settings.
",1
"Excellent keyboard but Japanese please!
",1
"Does not work in dolphin browser on my GS3.
",1
"Now need feature to backup learned language from typing.
",1
"Why still not support Chinese?
",1
"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",1
"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
",1
"It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",1
"Easily the best keyboard on Google Play, just needs to catch up with Asian language support, especially Japanese.
",1
"Just needs to add quick-insert of predefined strings, and a few tweaks such as completion with hyphen.
",1
"Taking up too much memory of late on jb 37mb at times
",1
"Prediction and ai learning how you type stopped working!
",1
"But keyboard too small on my Motorola ATRIX.
",1
"Good keyboard, great predictions, but loses stars for not having macrons.
",1
"Please implement macrons!
",1
"I love this app but how come chinese is still unavailable?
",1
"When it support Chinese!!
",1
"But it not have Vietnamese language.
",1
"Could u guys please add Chinese to the languages list?
",1
"When I use the multitasking multi windows, the SwiftKey keyboard stays the same size when in the Samsung keyboard it gets smaller and the keyboard Window is able to be moved around.
",1
"One fault could be the lack of personal dictionary as it doesn't allow you to save words you use the most etc other than that it's brilliant.
",1
"Would rate this 5  if it  had Japanese language.
",1
"I saw the update but disappointed to see no Japanese input yet.
",1
"It's a fairly good keyboard but the autocorrection isn't very strong.
",1
"For example, typing pf isn't changed to of.
",1
"For some strange reason the swiftkey keyboard keep on skipping keystrokes in random places as I type, making it completely impossible for me to type
",1
"Awesome must have, but no emoji.
",1
"And the Swedish dictionary is broken, splits composite words up.
",1
"still not loading automatixally at boot even with 4.1.1 os sammy s3
",1
"I hate how it keeps capitalizing the letter ""i"" even tho auto capital is off...
",1
"My ""enter""  or ""return""  key has disappeared while using WhatsApp.
",1
"Even in GoSms, the enter key has shifted to the last row and it's place has been taken by the back arrow key.
",1
"It's great keyboard but I've waiting for THAI that you're developing :-)
",1
"It's be nice if you could edit smileys or if you had multiple smiley sets to choose from.
",1
"Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
",1
"Frustrating since I had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so I'm happy.
",1
"Great app but wish there were more themes
",1
"Sure would like to see some new themes
",1
"Keeps switching back to the dafult Samsung keyboard.
",1
"Reset of phone required to fix issue temporarily.
",1
"The only thing needed is swype to make it complete :)
",1
"When it has 2 languages selected it mostly makes predictions in one
",1
"Great app very easy to use and I love the level of customisation but is does suffer from over sampling the keystrokes while the phone is being charged.
",1
"Otherwise perfect, although this is kind of a big deal.
",1
"I could not even personalize my writing style.
",1
"I want it to be able to learn from whatsapp too!
",1
"please add emojis and other stuff
",1
"You might also have to change a few small settings to taylor it how you want it to auto space, period, and what not.
",1
"Currently messes up when trying to type comments, messages etc on the mobile website version of Facebook.
",1
"It would be better if it could be used on Google Search and on my browser.
",1
"I just wish it worked on my Facebook..
",1
"but lags like hell often when u wake up the phone after deep sleep and feel like smashing my phone ..
",1
"Great app but needs to be a little more customizable, or more themes.
",1
"Also, a selection of copyright and trademark symbols , ?, this very important key is currently; hard to find.
",1
"This vital key should be front and center considering the level of proprietary issues, that arise; daily, from social media postings; from general observational
",1
"And now it doesnt want to download the english or spanish
",1
"Is there anyway swift key can create a red color theme?
",1
"Watsapp conflict + more
",1
"The keyboard is great, but hard to use with one hand.
",1
"Only thing missing for me is a <3 emoticon.
",1
"Punctuation key is annoying.
",1
"Please give option for tighter or old keyboard layout.
",1
"Arrow keys are unnecessarily large.
",1
"1. Predictive text would be great while typing at anytime on the phone, not just for sms.
",1
"The whole number/symbol entry screen needs to be redone.
",1
"But one major flaw on this for a fast typer is the lack of MULTI TOUCH support.
",1
"And for god sake why don't you put an option to turn off ""family filter"" so i can write properly instead of seeing duck everytime i want to write something else.
",1
"I wish you could still use swype but everything else is AWESOME
",1
"Wish I had options to make font larger on the keys, like A.I. Keyboard.
",1
"Wish the keyboard could show Gtalk's emoticons.
",1
"If there is a negative comparing the 2 it would be the lack of customisation compared to smart keyboard pro, which is endless!
",1
"It would also be nice to have more themes or support for third party themes.
",1
"Why isn't the predictive typing working in dolphin browser?
",1
"I like swype but the space bar is too small.
",1
"Here's any idea you guys should come out with different key board themes for each holiday like if you agree
",1
"It would be good if this paid for app would be a bit more configurable ie allow me to add an apostrophe on the main keyboard rather than have to go to the supplementary one
",1
"Smilies as default on the enter key are a deal breaker for me.

"The update killed it on my thunderbolt. :( it says its turned on but I only get factory keyboard when I type
",1
"I just wish they had more language options like Japanese and Chinese, which I hope will come soon.
",1
"I'm hoping we are getting some new Good themes!!!
",1
"Why they decided to put numbers on the left side and symbols on the right is beyond me (rather than numbers along the top and symbols on the rest).
",1
"Please continue develop the Spanish language.
",1
"It works well but there should be an option for adding custom words to the dictionary.
",1
"Currently enter key does not commit best to match.
",1
"Also not happy with the collection-of-data warning at the beginning of installation.
",1
"Love the keyboard and all its features, but I have not been able to bill my provider's acct for Google play downloads ever since installing it.
",1
"Without the personalized dictionary, I uninstalled it.
",1
"Also, they need to make enoticons easier to access...
",1
"Please add marathi and hindi language support and the app will be the perfect keyboard  for 5 stars.
",1
"Please add the marathi and hindi font.
",1
"Only complaint is it would be nice to import settings from the trial.
",1
"It would be nice if they had more keyboard customizing.
",1
"Add some more themes, keypad and key press tones..
",1
"Not as accurate as it used to be.
",1
"I only wish it was trace/swipe text capable.
",1
"Please make the tablet version an option inside this app.
",1
"Only minor issue I have is I wish there was more themes for the key board
",1
"My favorite, really, but it makes me have to switch to other input methods because of the lack of Chinese support.
",1
"No problems at all, better than stock Samsung, but like others are saying, a personal dictionary would be great and the word shortcuts.
",1
"SwiftKey plus chrome plus certain types of forms (particularly ones that require an email address) leads to a very ugly slow motion crash on ics.
",1
"need to fix arabic on jelly bean
",1
"Recently experiencing freezing at times in landscape.
",1
"Every time I'm typing a long status on face book this keyboard will take words I'm typing and put them in the beginning of the status.
",1
"uses excessive amounts of ram...
",1
"I tend to hit the letter ""b"" instead of the space bar sometimes and it fails to predict that I'm trying to hit the space bar.
",1
"This crashes at minimum ten times a day during web browsing via Chrome.
",1
"the. com button when typing in a browser url is the most annoying thing about this keyboard.
",1
"I love the keyboard but when I type texting 6 times and it shows tearing I get a bit frustrated.
",1
"Gets removed as default keyboard after every reboot.
",1
"Too bad, because I did enjoy the features of SwiftKey, but I make so many errors using SwiftKey on the HOX that I can't use it.
",1
"Can you PLEASE fix the lag with ics?
",1
"But won't  stay as default when start up or reboot?
",1
"Constantly crashes, slows down the phone, and uninstalls active language to force internet connection establishment.
",1
"This app shouldn't require constant internet connection to work.
",1
"Font doesn't change with theme.
",1
"Backspace is often triggered as well randomly.
",1
"The default keyboard setting for SwiftKey is going away when I remove the battery.
",1
"Suggestions are awesome, but not many things annoy me as much as when I type something and SwiftKey changes it to something wrong even though I didn't choose a suggtion.
",1
"Chrome + SwiftKey = constant freeze and crash.
",1
"It's getting tedious setting SwiftKey as my keyboard each time.
",1
"The space that inserts after a punctuation is fairly annoying.
",1
"And 30 to 40 mb is too much for a keyboard.
",1
"Doesn't predict swears, custom words, or abbreviations w/ symbols (ie. ""w/"").
",1
"You select the correct spelling and nothing happens.
",1
"Typing an email address is a pain in the ass with this app.
",1
"One little thing annoys me tho: the auto correct is really stubborn!
",1
"There are plenty more like me - see your ""new features"" topics on your support pages. An option to disable this would restore 5 stars.
",1
"Only annoying bug on JB, is that whenever i reboot my phone, the keyboard reverts back to the JB one.
",1
"Upgraded to an LG intuition and, while it still functions properly, it does not stretch across the screen.
",1
"For some reason, my nexus s defaults to Samsung keyboard and it really annoys.
",1
"The latest update causes Chrome to constantly crash on the S2.
",1
"Had to stop using this keyboard because it's made browsing impossibly slow and frustrating.
",1
"On occasion, the words selection bar doesn't appear and the letters typed are not accepted by the application.
",1
"when I reboot my phone (Nexus S) the stock android keyboard is the default one, so I have to go back to the settings to make swiftkey the default keyboard again.
",1
"Was great when first purchased but following an update it no longer works on my HTC Desire HD.
",1
"My use case: Type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard. In my scenario (three languages, de/en_US/he) this fails a lot (I think mostly with German words).
",1
"4 stars because no predictive text in web browser on JellyBean Galaxy S3 LTE.
",1
"Typing email addresses and other long but irregular words can be a pain.
",1
"Deleted after a week or so as it was constantly irritating me and just wouldnt let certain words go .
",1
"It shows up briefly after long press(which is inconvenient too) and goes away after a fraction of a second.
",1
"Basically, you don't have to release the long press to get the long press option.
",1
"But please add Chinese language support, really need it.
",1
"When in horizontal view you can't see any of the other persons messages. I even changed the layout to small to give more room but still won't show.
",1
"It's pointless to even go horizontal if you can read anything.
",1
"Every time I restart my Note 2 (AT&T) I have to re select swift key again to use it.
",1
"How about a character counter.
",1
"When I am writing on some apps that limit characters, such as a status update, I can't see how much I have put in without hitting the back button.
",1
"You could add a character count on the right above/below the send button.
",1
"Would be even better if the personal dictionaries could be synced to cloud.
",1
"Could be more customizable.
",1
"I just took one star off because shortcuts/ personal dictionary would make it perfect.
",1
"But continuously 'disappears.' All settings are correct but it will not appear when I need to type something!!
",1
"Also, I'm ready for more themes.
",1
"Was great on my nexus s but on the Xperia u it causes quite a bit of lag on coming up and down to the point where the whole phone feels sluggish.
",1
"That isn't to say that the dwiftkey keyboard is bad, if it weren't for the lag it would be great
",1
"What I like here is the intelligence and the prediction power, which, by the way, can be improved.
",1
"Now the prediction is based just on recent writing, if I go back to continue a bit older texts with special terminology I realize that all the power of prediction is gone, have to learn it again from zero..
",1
"And in Romanian predictions are not even close to those in English..
",1
"However, now with Jellybean 4.1.2 when swift key is selected as default keyboard, it takes quite awhile for the keyboard to open up.
",1
"It's would be refreshing to see other keyboard themes.
",1
"Sometimes the suggestions don't pop up.
",1
"When is more themes coming
",1
"It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
",1
"But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
",1
"My only issue is lack themes! Please add way more .
",1
"PLZ FIX TO WHERE THE KEYS WILL RESPOND TO PPL THAT TYPES FAST IT FREEZES ALOT N IM A QUICK TXTER
",1
"Unfortunately, the keyboard is simply not visible when using Chrome.
",1
"Awesome keyboard but lacks pen detection for Note ii. Please include this in the next update :D
",1
"its a bit of a hassle to keep on changing between this and stock keyboard when I want to use the S-Pen Thanks :D
",1
"I wish it had trace however.
",1
"Need more themes.
",1
"Need t9 input
",1
"My use case: Type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard.  In my scenario (three languages, de/en_US/he) this fails a lot (I think mostly with German words).
",1
"Type something, select the completion and the current text isn't replaced with the selected word, but removed entirely.
",1
"Combining multiple languages in one keyboard (one for de/en_US instead of two different) is crap as well.
",1
"The portrait mode doesn't give me a predictions anymore.
",1
"But it makes my browser crash allmost everytime I use it.
",1
"Great except every time the phone turns off it resets to the default Samsung keyboard.
",1
"Any reason why I can't load language packs?
",1
"Some apps result in SwiftKey replacing the enter key with the smiley key as primary and long press as enter.
",1
"If there was an option to remove the smiley and leave as enter this wouldn't be an issue.
",1
"1, an option to add/remove words from the dictionary is present. The current method for word learning requires a few uses of the desired word.
",1
"2, a backup feature, so I don't lose my dictionary when I migrate phones.
",1
"SwiftKey 3 its crashing in web browser (chrome and stock browser) while selecting search bar and editing txt.
",1
"Although you should make more themes.
",1
"It doesn't seem to access my Gmail for personalization, it keeps saying failed.
",1
"Is there no way of changing the language priorities?
",1
"Faroese language is not registered, and I understand why because it is so small, but I wish I somehow could personalize the languages even more.so that it automatickly remebers faroese words
",1
"runbish, installed but wouldnt download languages so couldnt use it pluss couldnt re fund
",1
"Has been my keyboard of choice for a while but it just doesn't work on Jelly Bean -
",1
"if you can't download the language packs you can't use the keyboard!
",1
"Cannot download the languages or use it
",1
"I just heard all these good things about this app and then right from the start the languages don't download...
",1
"Before it started hiding key. When you long press a key to get the options it hides behind the other keys but only on 3rd party text boxes.
",1
"But there should be more themes
",1
"PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz
",1
"The keyboard itself is great but the word predictions are atrocious.
",1
"Why can't it learn directly from all of my typing, instead of having to via gmail, twitter or Facebook - none of which I have.
",1
"Please improve the predictions.
",1
"It's alright I guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
",1
"But keeps failing to download English language pack update so now I have no autocorrect :(
",1
"I would give it a 5 star as it's perfect but it's annoying that despite being set as my default keyboard I still have to switch to it every time my phone restarts.
",1
"I like the speed it allows me to type but the predictions that automatically insert when I don't notice change my word completely.
",1
"And the most annoying thing of all that hasn't been fixed yet by any update, is the app some how turns off my haptic feed back.
",1
"There's a bug where the predictive keyboard doesn't always register. You have to come out of the message and go back into it.
",1
"The word prediction is spot on, the different themes look great, but the inability to use swype is annoying, as is the inability to use ALT+backspace to delete an entire line of text.
",1
"Because if a user inputs a VALID word, the program should NOT auto-replace it with anything else, no matter how much more relevant it thinks that is.
",1
"Only thing lacking is the ability for handwriting with note 2 spen.
",1
"I'd like it more context sensitive (eg: email vs sms, my gf vs my boss,  etc), but not sure if android passes that info.
",1
"IT FORCES CLOSE WHEN USING ON CHROME, quite randomly, but too often to be acceptable.
",1
"But has an annoying habit of auto correcting correctly spelt shorter words into inappropriate longer ones.
",1
"this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of memory
",1
"As I'm typing the cursor jumps to the middle of a sentence.
",1
"It has some great features, but there is a noticeable lag with my GSM Galaxy Nexus.
",1
"the whole point of the Samsung Galaxy is the swiping, it differs from every other kind of phone, and this app does not support swiping this app sucks,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!!!!!!
",1
"5 stars when i can disable prediction in favor of more screen real estate.
",1
"Was working fine until it said that it is unable to load language packs, including English!
",1
"1. Landscape is always full screen (no option)
",1
"2. No option to toggle auto-space after punctuation and selecting predicted/corrected word.
",1
"2. Prediction doesn't show up in a lot of cases where it should - should always pop up unless in a username or password dialog.
",1
"4. Speech to text doesn't come up reliably - many times pops up and immediately disappears.
",1
"5.  Sometimes sluggish to open / type.
",1
"Why there is no Chinese language in this keyboard.
",1
"And also pls have more theme color
",1
"Would give 5 stars but it keeps defaulting back to the stock keyboard.
",1
"I would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a SWYPE style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
",1
"Lately there has been issues where the auto correct won't work and sometimes I'll type but nothing pops up, not until I try like 100 times
",1
"1) SwiftKey should learn from sms, Gmail etc automatically without having to go through settings manually. Before I knew this it annoyed me SwiftKey wasn't learning from my sms.
",1
"2) when you type a word that's not in the dictionary and SwiftKey changes it to something I don't want, when I backspace I should have my originally typed word as an option.
",1
"I just wish I could download more themes
",1
"In the configuration screen I set it as my default keyboard but after a while it keeps shifting to another keyboard.
",1
"Wish we had a support forum about the product we download.
",1
"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",1
"Please add emoji there is alot of free keyboards have the emoji symbols :-$
",1
"Phones keeps hanging and crashing after last update
",1
"very nice keyboard but only thing lacking is choice of themes.
",1
"almost all themes are with closely spaced keys.
",1
"you guys shud add more themes like sony keyboard style or iphone style or stock android jellybean look
",1
"Loving this keyboard so far, would give it 5 stars except that there is no support for Chinese typing yet.
",1
"Minor niggles are: Please make apostrophes, colons and semi-colons behave like commas and full stops. ie automatic changing of space position.
",1
"Apostrophes could be dealt with better too with respect to prompting.
",1
"Only problem I ever had was that it often capitalizes words it shouldn't. Like the dutch word ""door"" or ""dank"".
",1
"Perhaps implement swipe that works as well as Google's implementation and I'll try it again?
",1
"My only gripe is that it doesn't have more black themed keyboard for us AMOLED screen users (to save power!).
",1
"The Neon theme is getting a little old...
",1
"It crashes every time when I add tags into Tumblr app.
",1
"I wish it was swype capable
",1
"Only if there were more options to customize the UI.
",1
"Got no use for smileys, instead I'd like to bind that to open the second page of special characters.
",1
"Doesn't learn some words despite multiple entries.
",1
"And now it's failing to show the predictive word bar.
",1
"Works great except several times everyday I have to set it as my default.
",1
"Got annoyed after they teased us with an upcoming swype like feature and haven't heard anything about it since...
",1
"Well would be better if it were a bit more customizable where the user can define the words and shortcuts.
",1
"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",1
"Since I updated to 4.2, the keyboard has been way slower.
",1
"Unable to install after second step.
",1
"Seriously what's with them having access to everything we type???
",1
"Would love it if it had more symbols though :)
",1
"Not the first time the bloody thing outdates all language packs with no warning when I have no network access.
",1
"The only thing it's missing is more character options!!
",1
"Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
",1
"It's an amazing keyboard except that if you misspell a word and it underlines it, and you select the proper word it doesn't actually change it. It just puts the cursor at that location.
",1
"This is a great app even if now there is the new android 4.2 but to get 5 stars it HAS to have SWIPE like in the new version of android!!!!!
",1
"I only wish there was an option to disable the instant space after a punctuation.
",1
"I constantly hit the space bar after inserting a period which adds a word that I didn't want there.
",1
"On jellybean now on note 2. Really buggy now.
",1
"Very slow to backspace through words and randomly won't display autocorrect suggestions or correct anything.
",1
"Have to close keyboard and reopen to get suggestions way too often.
",1
"Has been brilliant but something has caused the language packs not to download!
",1
"But on my Thunderbolt multi touch has issues.
",1
"It's a very good application but it support traditional Chinese language will be perfect.
",1
"One thing though, it always corrects ""texting"" to ""testing"" is texting not a word or something?
",1
"A few more themes would be nice.
",1
"Only thing missing is a clipboard but other than that it fires on all cylinders
",1
"My only complaint is that every time I restart the phone, it goes back to the default factory Samsung keyboard.
",1
"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",1
"Can't turn off the auto inserted space after a period or question mark. All my messages now have extra spaces after them.
",1
"Love this keyboard, but every time I turn the handset off and on it loses default settings.
",1
"Only one problem is that I don't always get the word select option in some apps such as Firefox.
",1
"It's the best keyboard I have used by far, and I love the themes (but maybe a couple more? Or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change ""love"" to ""live"" (or something similar).
",1
"Edit: Half the time, dragging for punctuation deletes the word I'm typing since JB update.
",1
"Some of the layout designs annoy me and it takes a long-press to activate voice typing which is frustrating when in a hurry.
",1
"Worked a couple times before crashing.
",1
"Now can't get beyond choosing English language download due to 'network error', no matter how good my connection is.
",1
"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
",1
"Trying to type a username and the autocorrect changes it.
",1
"Good app but ever since my phone updated to jelly bean today, the keyboard has been a little laggy.
",1
"And the hepatic feedback feels different than it did before. Even at 2ms I can feel it way more than I could before when it was at 7ms, which is inconvenient.
",1
"And what's with not being able to put arrow keys on the tablet version?
",1
"I'd really like to see a winter/Christmas theme like they havr for Halloween though.
",1
"Also doesnt have a feature to minimize the keyboard. I could not access a certain app one time because of this.
",1
"so when I am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back. not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
",1
"additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space.
",1
"I find myself constantly switching between LastPass & SwiftKey Keyboards. :-\
",1
"Although it kinda Sucks how I had to pay for multiple Downloads for each of my devices.
",1
"i like everything about this app with 1 (very significant) exception.no swipe feature.
",1
"i am super-dependent on using swipe to enter words, so without that, there's no real point in me having this app.
",1
"It won't autocorrect my misspellings when set to inert a period with double space.
",1
"when set to insert a prediction, will insert a random word whenever I use punctuation and then space.
",1
"the only problem i have is the themes, needs more.
",1
"The only issue I have is lack of themes.
",1
"Also, no Japanese support!? ...
