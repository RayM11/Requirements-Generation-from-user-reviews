Review
"Its worth every cent.
"
"Finally a keyboard that is beautiful and easy to use.
"
"Detects different languages without swapping in the settings.
"
"I barely have to type, it knows what I want to say.
"
"Excellent app.....
"
"I didn't type fueling either.
"
"I'm more of a precision typist but this app makes all the difference when typing quickly.
"
"I can't wait until SwiftKey Flow is released.
"
"Shut up and take my money
"
"Only app I have every paid for and not just side loaded with an APK.
"
"Thanks for such a great app
"
"Was my fav,paid & 1st apk installed everytime.
"
"But sam has similar predictive technology built in note2 keyboard now & IMO does it better!
"
"Sam has 4-28 or more predictions.
"
"The hidden gem's in Samsung Chinese IME Keyboard.change tat setting to english & voila!works just like swiftkey with auto selection,except row of predicted words in top row drastically increased!
"
"Standard Sam keyboard has same tech but no auto selection.
"
"SwiftKey Flow FTW!
"
"This keyboard is an essential android app.
"
"Can't imagine not using it.
"
"Seems to be a waste if money.
"
"You have saved me so much frustration!
"
"Love love love this!!
"
"Saved me a lot of time and frustration.
"
"I have used and purchased almost all of the main brand keyboards out there, by far swift key has been the best at a fairly placed price.
"
"I have been using swift key for about a week now and I had already saved me 10,000 key strokes.
"
"Before typing would be boreing and now it's the best feature on my phone.
"
"Thanks SwiftKey, keep up the good work.
"
"I've been using this since I had my HTC EVO 3D.
"
"Used it on my Galaxy Note I and now on my Note II.
"
"However, now that the BETA version of the new ""Flow"" is available, I have since been using that.
"
"Flow adds the greatness of regular SKX with Swype.
"
"Helped improve my typing a ton.
"
"Much faster and fixes my errors like none other.
"
"I downloaded another keyboard app and there is no problem with it.
"
"Once resolved, I will go back to a 5-star rating.
"
"Until then, I will be using another keyboard and rating this app 1-star.
"
"Currently trying Flow, which is wonderful, but this keyboard even without Flow has always been perfect.
"
"Very user friendly, great typo correction and I loooove the auto correct that can overcome accidentally missing the space bar.
"
"not again back to swype least they try to support users
"
"I downloaded this and sent a total of two texts before I HAD to buy this.
"
"This is so amazing. I suggest this to any phone.
"
"It honestly predicted this entire message.
"
"Best keyboard for Android
"
"Took a little while to get it just how I wanted but will never change it now,  great
"
"But after going through with the settings, I saw that there is an option to let this software read through my sms', emails', tweets' content, and identify patterns.
"
"Now I don't have to type, 'Honey,  I'm on my way'.
"
"I just have to type, hon and honey with capital letters H appears.
"
"I just have to tap on it, and one by one other wordings of I'm on my way home appears, and all I have to do then is, tap on each of them.
"
"No longer will I be making ridiculous typos like in the title of the this review!
"
"Only been using this app for a day but I'm VERY impressed!
"
"I've never typed so fast on a phone before and I've got a lot of practice!
"
"Wish I had bought this earlier!
"
"Feels sluggish sometimes...
"
"Holy hwll this is more annoying than anything.
"
"By far the best keyboard app ever!
"
"Coming from a full qwerty slider, this app has relieved most of my annoyance with having to type on a touchscreen.
"
"All the reviews on this keyboard are pretty accurate this keyboard is accurate, and that's one thing I missed about my old iPhone, this keyboard seems even better.
"
"The jelly beans keyboard was good, this is more than awesome.
"
"It is practical.
"
"No need to do a manual switch between languages, which increase by far productivity especially when half of your contacts in SMS or email are in French and English.
"
"The stock keyboard is much faster...
"
"Great keyboard
"
"It's worth the money^_^
"
"I had this on my LG P500 & now I have it on my Samsung Galaxy S3, it's the best keyboard, super accurate and amazing to be able to personalize!
"
"Glitchy though.
"
"The keyboard works awesome.
"
"It's by far the best keyboard I have ever used.
"
"SwiftKey keyboard
"
"Combines English and Afrikaans keyboards flawlessly!
"
"If you daily have to text in different languages THIS IS the keyboard to get.
"
"It supports three of them and the utilisation is flawless!
"
"A real pleasure.
"
"Moreover the prediction is scary of accuracy!
"
"Predictions works amazingly, you have to use 30 days trial to believe.
"
"It has never worked, very annoying.
"
"Other than that it's effing amazing.
"
"This app is so much better than the onboard keyboard.
"
"I make typos like crazy and it almost made me miss my iphone but this app has made everything so much better.
"
"It is incredibly accurate with fixing any mistyped and the predictions are amazing.
"
"Sometimes it feels like it reads my mind.
"
"Best keyboard that I used ever.
"
"I love it!
"
"Great app, this is the only app i've ever paid for,saves so much time, highly recommended, especially to quick or lazy typists.
"
"I love this app!
"
"Galaxy S 3 -  I love this keyboard.
"
"Predictions are awsome.
"
"Never thought I will get use to a touch screen phone but this keyboard is just awsome.
"
"Everybody should deff get it.
"
"Once the trial version is over you are gonna want to get it.
"
"Again I love itttt.
"
"Two letters aren't working on my keyboard c and v.
"
"Why did I pay for this app....ugh
"
"I have an S3 and the default keypad was not that great on that.
"
"This however is a vast improvement and I love it so much.
"
"I love how you can have different.
"
"Themes for the keyboard.
"
"So its not the same old bland one also I like how double tap space leaves a full stop where as before it never did.
"
"Great app really do recommend.
"
"I really can't understand why this has good ratings its rubbish
"
"I love this keyboard, have tried all the others i keep coming back to this one.
"
"Been using this since gingerbread.
"
"Worked great with that and ics.
"
"Still waiting for a fix before switching back to stock or using smart keyboard, etc.
"
"Dont know what but until ita fixed I cant use it.
"
"Ill change to 5 stars when it is.
"
"Never really buy apps but the reviews i have heard on this forced me into it.
"
"wow so impressive!
"
"I I'm dyslexic and this makes life so quick and easy
"
"I've thus far loved this keyboard.
"
"From the great easy setup to the great predictions.
"
"Excellent keyboard nice UI and IA
"
"Easily the best keyboard for android.
"
"Incredible word prediction.
"
"Saved many 1000's of key strokes
"
"The absolutely best testing app I've ever seen.
"
"Used to think swipe typing was the fastest but the prediction on this keyboard is a revelation.
"
"Makes one hand or two hand typing really fast.
"
"Worth the price.
"
"Even Google's new keyboard in 4.2 with real time prediction doesn't match this.
"
"This is a wonderful keyboard.
"
"I couldn't use anything else now that I have tried it.
"
"I haven't used a different keyboard since I bought this one, just because it's amazing.
"
"Like my title says, the auto correct is near perfect.
"
"Never thought I would like a keyboard better than swype but now I do.
"
"I think it's very smart that you guys decided to make it as an update for those who have already purchased instead of making us buy it again.
"
"On another note I didn't think this keyboard could get any better!
"
"It's just... Perfect
"
"Been on SwiftKey for over a year now, it is responsive and the prediction engine is excellent.
"
"I especially love the num pad, much more intuitive than a row of numbers.
"
"I even tried the latest stock Android 4.2 keyboard (which has swipe like feature) and am very sure I can type faster on SwiftKey.
"
"Much better that the stock keyboard.
"
"Predictive text works really well.
"
"It can predict text for you or offer suggestions.
"
"Must have application for your phone.
"
"Just makes typing look so easy!
"
"Buy for sure.
"
"keyboard is a vital tool on any smartphone.
"
"This app takes the default keyboard to a whole new level.....
"
"You will be amazed by how much it adapts and the auto correction tailored to you!
"
"Love this & the tablet version!
"
"Easy to use & very intuitive.
"
"I am very pleased with the SwiftKey keyboard.
"
"I wasn't sure another keyboard app would make a difference but it certainly has.
"
"I thought I would try it and see how it works, and am very glad I did.
"
"Almost went back to a phone that has a keyboard.
"
"I have only owned it for a short time, but so far so good
"
"worked fine until about 3 days ago.
"
"Excellent app!!!!!!
"
"This drives me mad as the Samsung keyboard is terrible.
"
"Is this a problem with JB, the S3 or SwiftKey?
"
"After using this keyboard now for several months I have had no problems with it.
"
"The themes are great and the usability is great.
"
"The GB keyboard is awful and so is the ICS keyboard.
"
"This is a must have tool and it really makes your device much more usable.
"
"But apart from that it's great.
"
"It appears to be a minor glitch and not an actual function of the keyboard itself.
"
"In lieu of these issues being adjusted, I will give 5 stars.
"
"Briliant App.
"
"Easy, to go use and u also have tutorials when u use it for the first time.
"
"Saved me over 15.000 keystrockes until now.
"
"Also has very nice themes.
"
"Totally worth buying.
"
"This keyboard is really not that good.
"
"I don't notice a big difference between this and stock.
"
"I don't like to buy apps but I tried the free trial of this and I had to buy it!
"
"I can't live without it.
"
"It's like part of my texting lifestyle :))
"
"it predicts what I type!
"
"Definitely worth it buying!!!
"
"Best transition app from a blackberry.
"
"It knows what your going to write and corrects any mistakes better than anything I've ever seen.
"
"This beats Auto correct on iphone bar none!!
"
"Keep up the good work and keep giving updates
"
"Best app ever, its like having auto correct 50 years in the future
"
"I like it,  simple to configure and use and saves me time from editing my messages after quick typing.
"
"I recommend for anybody looking for quicker productivity.
"
"Best keyboard for Android
"
"Have reinstalled several times.
"
"One if the best keyboards ive used but the screen on my phone is way to sensitive
"
"I've had enough of this keyboard.
"
"I shouldn't have to do extra for it not to do this so I've gone back to using stock.
"
"I every time I have a friend that has a new phone u suggest this app.
"
"Can't wait for flow I'm very eager.
"
"Saves so many mistakes and increases productivity.
"
"Very useful, handy,  can add several languages at the same time...
"
"Nice pumpkin color...
"
"When I wiped my phone, the few days I didn't have this installed I just wouldn't type much because it was such a hassle compare to the fantastic ease when I use Swiftkey
"
"Wonderful keyboard and way better than the one that came on my default.
"
"Best keyboard app I have used.
"
"The Samsung keyboard kept crashing and the Swipe kept registering strange finger taps that didn't happen.
"
"The SwiftKey just works.
"
"The default keyboard on my device sucks.
"
"I spent more time fighting with it then typing.
"
"And I also use multiple languages.
"
"This application made a huge difference and is well worth the money.
"
"My wife has a smart phone from that fruit company.
"
"She says she wishes SwiftKey was available from her store.
"
"The predicted text is awesome!
"
"Love it!
"
"I love this app for my phone but I'm annoyed I have to buy another version to run on my tablet.
"
"This is easily the best keyboard for android right now and it's always being updated.
"
"Great App
"
"I just love this keyboard.
"
"It predicts your next word before you even think about it.
"
"Makes typing on a phone so much easier.
"
"A big thanks to the developers of this application.
"
"Had to uninstall.
"
"Totally worth every penny,  a no Brainer my hats off to the developers
"
"Nexus One on Gingerbread
"
"Makes it completely useless
"
"only for swiftkey to break it.
"
"a shame, really.
"
"since it is really the one thing that sets them apart from the rest of the other keyboard apps out there.
"
"Other than that, Its great app.
"
"once that feature is in place, i'll be back on board 100%.
"
"something is strange :(
"
"version 2 was perfect.
"
"version 3 is just bad!
"
"Its hands down a great app and would recommend it to anyone.
"
"for me its the best keyboard ( only tested the free ones ) even tho was the best app i used for 30days i dint wanted to pay the full price
"
"i hate paying for apps that cost more than ?
"
"so i am happy for this SALE!
"
"dint think twice and just bought it, ?"
