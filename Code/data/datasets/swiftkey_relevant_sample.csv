review
"Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
"
"It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
"
"Love it but needs emoji support now
"
"I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
"
"Just add emojis and more themes.
"
"Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
"
"Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
"
"5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
"
"Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
"
"Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
"
"Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
"
"I have had this keyboard since I first got the Evo, I just love it, I wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!
"
"Emoji support would be awesome please.
"
"Awesome must have, but no emoji.
"
"please add emojis and other stuff
"
"Wish we had a support forum about the product we download.
"
"Please add emoji there is alot of free keyboards have the emoji symbols :-$
"
"I just need Chinese!!!
"
"Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
"
"Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
"
"Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
"
"Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
"
"I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
"
"It misses the hinglish language support.
"
"This keyboard is amazing for English but it doesn't have a Japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
"
"I love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the Chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
"
"But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
"
"SwiftKey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a Chinese input..
"
"Speaking of which though, I wish there was Japanese and Chinese available so I don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
"
"I saw the update but disappointed to see no Japanese input yet.
"
"It's great keyboard but I've waiting for THAI that you're developing :-)
"
"But it not have Vietnamese language.
"
"Were need Chinese input!!!
"
"Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
"
"Why is there no Tab key?
"
"But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
"
"I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
"
"Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
"
"C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
"
"Often times when I hit the ""A"" key I hit the shift key.
"
"SwiftKey please add: Swipe, personal dictionary and prediction for email and name.
"
"BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR ""!"" AND ""?""!!!
"
"If only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
"
"It is especially bad when I switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
"
"As mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
"
"I can't stand not having a dedicated '?' key.
"
"Arrow keys are unnecessarily large.
"
"How about a character counter.
"
"You could add a character count on the right above/below the send button.
"
"Also doesnt have a feature to minimize the keyboard. I could not access a certain app one time because of this.
