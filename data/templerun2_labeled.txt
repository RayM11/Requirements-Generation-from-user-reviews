lenten,ratingone,"but its really hard to buy upgrades and what not.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"the only thing wrong is that the magnet power up and the coin power up do not work.

leneighteen,ratingfour,"one down side is the sensitivity is kind of low, so it doesn't always register my moves.

",info
lenseventytwo,ratingfour,"if you're using an ability such as the coin magnet, and you run across another and pick it up before time runs out, the first game would renew the time remaining on the ability, but this game doesn't. it's worthless, and tends to punish you for getting upgrades that make your abilities last just long enough that it hadn't run out before you get to the next one.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"coin magnet no longer gives you a con multiplier.

lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this game doesn't work on lg 3d optimus i don't know why....
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"the only thing wrong with it is that it keeps freezing but only on the odd ocation

lensixteen,ratingthree,"since i updated, the game has become very lag and some time it even force close.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i got a glitches that made score 225,639,853 no lie
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"its a great game but i find the tilt and screen controls not responsive enough to survive.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"ok so this is wat happened i start to play nd then it froze and it kept doing it so someone needs to fix this!!!!
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"the only problem is it wont stop askin me to rate it so here u go now leave me alone
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"game is good butt objectives are way to tough almost impossible to reach level 9 it's should b in achievements rather than in objectives bad..
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"i am much above 500,000 coins, but the ""gold miner"" objective is not getting completed.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"even 1,000,000 coins objective is stuck and not progressing
",info

",info
lenten,ratingfour,"runs great on my s3 but sometime turns are un responsive
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"love this game but when the boost runs out on the zip line i still run really fast with no protection.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingtwo,"but today i started the app and the game was reset and i lost all my progress;i was on level 8 ,had a high score of 5,000,000+,multiplier 51 and i have lost it all.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"i was so excited to download this game since the original was so good i thought this one would be better but it wont even open
",info
lennine,ratingone,"midas touch and the other latest objectives are ridiculous.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"just admit we beat the game or create new content instead of setting some inhuman goals.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"freezes on my phone everytime i try to play it.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"great graphics and all but somehow the number of coins i connect keep getting reset to 1500 or less asseta point so i cannot buy or upgrade my characters.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"its really fun but kills my battery.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"but one thing i would really like to have in the next update are extra characters and pick up power ups stack on each other. :)
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"keeps with the style of the original with a new setting (china?).
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"although i do seem to have encountered an error trying to level up from lvl 8 (which is too hard btw!) it says to run a million points without power-ups.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"i've done this several times now but the achievement stays locked, while it did work for a friend who has the exact same phone as me..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"sometimes it comes on and works great but other wise it wont start
",info
leneight,ratingone,"the game just freezes to a black screen.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"only thing that sucks is that you have to go back to the beginning as opposed to starting where you left off.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"it was fine until it updated a few days ago after that it erased all my saved game and had to completely restart and it freezes up on me
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"a little of hang time in some transition.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"game is very fun and addictive but is extremely laggy on my samsung stratosphere.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"takes a minute plus to load and in-game lag causes me to lose before i can get very far.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"better than the first buy it sometimes gets confusing with this level design.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"on the last two obstacles and the total number of collected is frozen
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"it always exits ive had it for a while and every time it exits before i can even play so im warning
",info
lensixtyfour,ratingthree,"i played temple run 2 on one of my friends ipad and i loved it and when i download it it wont let me play it just goes to tue little s looking thing then it vibrayes my phone and then takes me back to my home screen i have uninstalled it amd redone it and everything it wont work and i really wanna play :(
",info
lenfortytwo,ratingthree,"iv played this on other devices but i dont understand why it doesnt work on my phone it stays on the loading screen and after awhile it takes me out of the app please help and yes its compatible on my phone
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"never get bored, love it wish you could create your own characters.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"keep crushing on htc desire :(
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"i downloaded the game and have never been able to get it to successfuly upload.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"cant get it downloded in my htc
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"i'll give it 5 stars if it would work for my lg thrill i never get past the picture before the start menu.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"this game was pretty fun at the beginning but after 15 minutes of playing it got really boring plus way to many ads.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i have obviously read in some rates and whenever i first open the app, it force closes.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i just bought 50,000 coins this weekend and they aren't on my game wtf come on man fix this
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"only suggestion: make it so that if you get a second power up while you are already using one,  it is not ignored.
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"game hangs if i press physical back button when re-incarnate with a gem option comes.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingtwo,"one of the objectives of lifetime 500,000 coins is stuck even though i have more than 600k. this happened after the same objective came twice.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"it's fun but it always exits for no reason.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingthree,"the double tap to use the power up when the bar gets full only works 1 out of 5 times  on the nexus 10 but on the siii the double tap to engage power up works perfectly fine, i don't understand.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"im a level 8 n the app wont open please fix with the next update i love this game but can't  it
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"the lag associated with the initial start of the game is annoying, but otherwise a great game all around.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"the only downside is that it is very repetitive  and the powerups are very dull,so at times the game os not fun.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"objectives not being updated accordingly
",info
lensixtyone,ratingtwo,"i love the graphics on this game but for some reason it doesn't keep count of how many coins i get/have it always says a lower number than what i started the run with dk if anybody else has this problem actually thinking bout deleting it becuz its irreating me too much not being able to get my upgrades
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"it's annoying when it is down to the luck of level generation whether or not i get a good score.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"the game is great but its always lagging on my droid 3.......
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"now the problem is i can play the game once after that everytime i try to open the game it backs out 2 my home page.....
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"in order for me to get to level 9 i had to beat an objective but i beat it and it wouldn't say i beat it
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"the game will not let me play it on my galaxy s why it do that please fix it
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"yea wellllll it's kinda slow.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"my only issue is that the 500,000 and 1,000,000 coin achievements are still bugged so i can't reach lvl 9!
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"the game is good but my coins keep getting deleted!!!!!!!!
",info
lennine,ratingone,"the app keeps crashing on my phone, need help.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"a change in the scenery would be nice as running over the same old ground becomes rather boring after awhile.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"the app does not let me load the menu please fix this.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"keeps getting stuck on the imangi studios screen and then returns to my home screen!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"the only things i would want are the power-ups to be able to stack and extend.
",info
lenthirtyeight,ratingfour,"example, picking up a coin magnet, and then picking up another one while the first one is going should extend the length if the power-up, but it does not, at least not the last 5 times i noticed.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfour,"also, i kinda wish that the list of objectives was available, i've had to hit some of the million mark objectives 2 or 3 times because it wasn't active on the list of three objectives.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"i did not get credit for collecting 500000 coins!
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"the progress bar froze!
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"i hate the fact you can only see 3 objectives at a time.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"in addition, i have a glitch that isn't giving me the 500,000 life time coins achievement.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"lastly, i'm experiencing glitches where i'll jump and i then appear way off the map and die
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"i paid two times 99 cents each for 5 pack of gemstone n was charged but never got the gems in the game.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"i kind of don't like temple run  2 because it makes you do only three objectives so this is my opion
",info
lennine,ratingone,"takes soooo long to load didn't like it
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"5 stars when there are more characters.
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"more pick ups?
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"the only reason i gaveit 4 stars is because sometime when i am at a high score and going fast it will sometimes lag alittle.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"but it has too many details so that you can't focuse on the game.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"over 500k coins lifetime, but did not get credit for completing objective.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"itdoesnt deserve 5 stars because it lags and sometimes it wont even let you interact with the game.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"i was really enjoying this game until it updated and i lost everything. all my upgrades and coins and gems.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"the whole game keeps crasshing it it keeps going upside down.

",info
lenten,ratingone,"as soon as i get past the tutorial it freezes.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"its fine for awhile but then it starts freezing up in the game and causes me to die.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"i dont really like how you have to move your device over to one side almost all of the way to tilt other than that its cool
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"so, i downloaded this, all excited, so i open it up and it goes to the little imagi studios picture, then it goes back to my home screen and that's it....help??

leneight,ratingfive,"the objective that needs 1000000 lifetime coins is stuck.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"even after completing 500,000 lifetime coins, it's not completing my objective of completing it.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"though downloading is slow bcz of big size application.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"1 which i'm sure a lot of people have but never noticed is that when you are on a one-wheeled turn in the tunnel, collected coins do not raise the power bar.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"2 i am in the last 2 challenges and the 1,000,000 lifetime coins meter will not fill up.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i have a little over 500,000 and the bar reads at about 200,000.

",info
leneleven,ratingone,"cannot play more than once then have to close from glitches
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"nice game  over all only 4 stars, coins are lost if you don't use them
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"the glitches are at a turn, it lags and even if i swipe, i fall.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"the second glitch is if i use the power up, then get the same ability, the ability ends at the same time as the power up.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"the imangi studios screen launches but the game won't open - kicks me out to whatever screen i was on before.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"love this game, but need to accumulate coins and gems!!!!
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"it wont let me exit or even shut my phone off because it froze so bad.

",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"i purchased 150 gems online and i also got charged for it but i didnt get any gems even after two emails sent to these guys.

",info
lenten,ratingone,"keeps on force closing fix it please.samsung galaxy s 4g
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"very difficult to play & collect coins .
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"it does kind of make your phone hot aftr a while and that messes up tilting because i had zero tilt response when it was heating up.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"sometimes it doesnt open and i have to delete it and redownload it to play
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"each time i try to jump or slide it freezes
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"i not able to complete 500,000 coin objective even though i have collected o er 550,000 coins.

",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"im already completed with the ""gold miner"" (500,000 lifetime coins) objective but it stays in my current objective. :(

",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i keep uninstalling and installing but it won't go past the imangi studios start screen.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"and when you die after you reach a certain point that is were you should start to make the game abit easier to play.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"battery drains too fast.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"the only problem is it some times freezes when playing
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"fun game, would get 5 if the game randomly lagging didn't result in me constantly losing
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"the game won't start
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingone,"it will not let me attain powerups if i trip monkey will not follow up still havent comepleted tutorial because after each an ever game it freezes as soon as i die.
",info
lenthirty,ratingthree,"i love this game it is the best ever but every time i play it and i press ""save me"" i have no more gems and the game shuts down.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"gathering coins dor upgrades is a little tedious.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"the objectives progress bar for collecting 500,000 coins & running 10,000,000 distance don't increase even though my stats show that i have collected 700,000 lifetime coins!
",info

",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"the graphics r good but it takes a lot of the battery and it lost all the coins that i earned after it froze
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i loved this game but every time i try and open it up it wont open.
",info
lenfifty,ratingthree,"this game makes me feel like the developers looked at the first game, saw all of the ""juddering"" complaints and just decided to ignore them - this game is better than #1 but suffers from the same juddering and lack of response during the slow down, ir's good but not great
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"this wont run on my samsung infuse
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"i use a samsung galaxy tab and every time i try to install this app it says 'error(498)' fix this?
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"the update was so amazing, it deleted all my temple run 2 data.
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfour,"i had trouble swiping and tilting, it was too low for both also when in the mine shaft, when you make a turn, you have to be very fast to tilt the mine cart the other way.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"just wish you could skip objectives.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"so my girlfriend wanted to play as the last chick so we bought the biggest coin pack over a day ago and never got any coins, uninstalling, any game that rips you off.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"would be better if the tilt was more responsive and the powerups renewed though.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"i had the game and enjoyed it for about a week and then lost my save and have to restart to 0/10 is my rating
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"please develop more stages, tasks, and scenery.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"the levels are the same and that's super boring!
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"though i have completed the objective of five lakh life time coins but it is not showing in   the completed objective
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"after level 8, you have to score 5 million coins to reach to next level which is boring
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"everytime i get up to 2000 coins all my coins reset and it makes me unable to buy new upgrades and people!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i have a samsung infuse and the game only shows the imangi studios screen before exiting game.
",info
lenfortyone,ratingone,"i went on today and it worked fine but i go on 10 minutes later and it starts me over from yhe tutorial and it cleared all my game history and i just got 3 million as my highscore yesterday, this game sucks!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"it wont let me open the app it worked till today please help it worked for a while now it stoped workin screw it
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"the objective doesn't complete, if it is not shown currently on the level screen.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"like for eg: if i've run 2,500m already, before it is shown as an objective in some level screen. it is still shown as incomplete objective.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"needs better graphics and sensitivity like temple run1. :-)
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"need to fix when you're on a  zipline and your speed boost ends you keep running fast forever
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfour,"will change to five if they fix bug as i have spent ages doing the objective to get 500,000 coins and now i have 500,100 coins and the bar is not even at half!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"all the upgrades i bought, all the coins and gems i collected were reset.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"and when i go into settings, and pressed back, it doesnt go back.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"when i play the game sometimes there are lagging times and ends up making me see different screens shots at once.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"needs lag fuxing update bad!
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"it was working perfectly and i had so many things then randomly it reset me back to having nothing.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"this app is really fun but its slow alot.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"it's very disappointing that i lost 5500+ coins bec i unlocked all runners and left with 5500+, when i got back to the game, the balance coins shows 0.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"also the coin counts used to reset to 0 when it reaches 2000 coins.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"its a good game but thr should b few level .
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"5 stars when you add tilt sensitivity, otherwise one of the most addicting games out there
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"random visual skips(pop ins) hurt game play sometimes.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"whenever i try to open it it would go to the play store
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"everytime i click temple run it goes to my home screen
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"just a little much sometimes, good graphics, feels like the swiping & tilting is a little behind sometimes.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfive,"so addictive but i have a kyocera hydro and i had to delete and reinstall because it would freeze now i have boo problems with it and i can not stay off it
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"it start off slow for as the movement.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"keeps losing most of my coins - so cannot upgrade.
",info
lenforty,ratingfour,"this game is fun and addicting as hell but most of the time (and especially after i reach a few million points) it starts lagging like crazy and i end up dying because the game doesn't detect my swipe.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i'm not sure if it was meant to be this way, but the power meter doesn't fill up any faster when my coin value is doubled or tripled.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"it doesn't make any sense to me why the power meter would count the actual coin number, rather than the coin values.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"still crashing please help i haven't played it once on my samsung galaxy tablet  please!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"it say always download is unsuccessful, try again
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"just a little laggy at times!
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"it's good but way to slow for me on htc could you make it faster at all?
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"used to work flawlessly before but now it crashes randomly.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"please fix, doesn't get past opening screen on lg optimus black.
",info
lenfiftythree,ratingfour,"liked the first temple run but this ones even better only thing is tht win ya got two things ya gota do back too back like swinging on the rope then ya drop off an have to jump the stream there isn't enough space to do those two things back to back.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"it gets pause for no reason on my fone (htc sensation xl). the touch graphics hv some sorta bug which is causing this.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"needs more power ups and abilities
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"although they should update to add new power ups and items.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i play it all the time, but sometimes it doesn't jump when i swipe.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"this game has not been working right my coins are always getting lost i hope you could fix this
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"i click the app and it goes to the homescreen.then it closes.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"only problem is that it take forever to load! :\
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"was great but turned on before and all my stats erased not a happy bunny!
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"but hate when it doesn't respond to my swiping actions.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"it still doesn't work for the lg thrill!
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"i try to open it up but i always get to the first screen then it just quits and goes back to my phones home screen!
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfour,"it laggs in places and is annoying at times but overall this game is amazing! <3 also i think there should be a release of temple run for windows phone 7 because i would love to play this on my mobile
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"when i play the game crash on me, although other than that, the graphics are great, and it is an awesome game.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"major bugs with achievements getting stuck. like lifetime 500,000 coins at ~60% when i have 600,000
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"can you guys make an update that involves more characters to work towards
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"this application opens but after two minutes on the imangi studios screen it automatically shuts down.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"it wont open when i download it i dont know why
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"then i appreciate the upgrades but the sensitivity is really bad and you guys didn't add the option to change it like tr1 .
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"also there are times when swiping makes the character jump off the cliff or slide when i swipe to turn.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"it won't even open on my phone so i'm like what the heck what a waste.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"the objective ""collect 500,000 lifetime coins"" doesn't work, i have the coins but no complete objective!
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"there use to a bug where it crashes when you try to use a save me.

",info

",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"original was better, dont like new graphics, still same concept but trying too hard i think
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"the only problem is you need to tilt to extreme right/left to avoid falling.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"the game would be near perfect if there were an option to change the sensitivity as it's a bit insensitive to my phone.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"have some lag issues on p970 at the lowest graphics which effects the game dramatically.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"i need lower graphics.

lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i can turn it down but it's still audible even at zero.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"its simply cool but coins are not getting more as compared ti older one
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"nearly at the point of not been able to see my phone when tilting it left and right sgs2
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"can't tilt left to right, game is a bit too much
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"it sits on the loading screen the whole time or just exits out of the game.
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"game wont start.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"it crashes whenever i start the game  please fix i have a sidekick 4g
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"in this game the tracks are cool but the animations aren't good.
",info
lenthree,ratingthree,"sensitivity needs improvement
",info
lenten,ratingone,"also freezes occasionally when i try to exit the game.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"it stays at imangi studios for about 20+ seconds before getting to the game.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"so everyone don't waste your time trying to download  this idiotic game, because it won't download.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"the screen of the game is too big and i can't see where i'm running.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"love the game but recently it started to freeze and close when you try to use a gem for save me.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"this is my favourate game on android but it was running smoothly before but after unlocking characters and upgrades it started lagging.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"good but it should have adjustable sensitivity in the settings.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"would've given a 5 star if the option to adjust sensitivity and the magnet powerup will not overlap with the magnet pickup.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"very fun, but every time i use a save me in a mineshaft it crashes and i lose all progress from that run.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"the game freezes and force closes quite a bit.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"this is a very addicting game, but there are a few issues concerning powerups and placement.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"installed but not fit on qvga screen whyy
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"hate that the magnet doesn't multiply coins but its still good.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"the turning is slow.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"it takes full second or more to turn.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"i've also twice experienced a bug with the boost where it flung me off the edge.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"very fun but its too laggy on my neo v ics
",info
lenfortyeight,ratingfour,"it has everything i was so surprised by it this game cant get any better it has tons of things and you just cant stop playing it but when i click on th save me button at the end of each run the game just exsits fix it.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"am usin galaxy tab but i cant download cos it alwys error
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"the menu layout sucks , the graphics are kinda stale but the game is way better than the first!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"only criticisn is it lags a few times.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"new cart level and zip line seem to glitch the boost power up leading to instant death.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"head start that uses 2500 coins activates automatically.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"freezing a lot on galaxy s3!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this game is fun but idk it wont let me download it mad
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"a fun game but crashes way too much!
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"why cant i get this downloaded, :(
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"i think this is a,really good and well made game, but when ever i used a shield over a river (not the one with the broken bridge) it glitches up :(
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"i've just downloaded this app twice and it doesn't work on my samsung galaxy tab gt p1010.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"it's a good game, but not as smooth as temple run 1.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"superb game but need to force close frequently that's why 3star otherwise 5star
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"lags a tiny bit sometimes but i'm sure optimization will fix that.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"and its a little confusing on what to upgrade and stuff.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"there was no explanation of how powerups work, why is it that when i spend 20 gems to max out the magnet powerup, after one game goes down by  half?
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"this is game is way addicting and super fun but i hate when i try to use my gems sometimes that it crashes and doesnt save my progress.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"i was at 10500 when it crashed last no joke.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"does not fit my screen right at all!
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i purchased a set of gold and it still hasn't shown up in my game, several days later.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"great game,  just one thing,  when i just miss falling off of those half paths,  my guy keeps running while on his side,  even jumping while lying down.
",info
lenfortysix,ratingone,"i am using an htc explorer and also have temple rum 1 but some games like raging thunder and tempal run 2 don't work whenever i turn them on it says program not responding please help even when i download apps from 4shared it says download failed help
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"i love it alot butt its kind of hard it works great for my phone but takes alot of space but i really do like it.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i didn't  find  exit button  on  tab2  then  i   have  to  open task manager  and  close   but  i  like   this game   i request  to  play store  to    make  exit   button
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"i hate the little ride on the tracks but it makes the game harder.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"i don't know how the game was because the ""package file was invalid""
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"anytime i upgrade the 'boost' power up, however, i go to upgrades or anywhere else and the spent gems are still gone and the power up remains not upgraded.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"its fine and smooth, maybe more characters?
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"graphics stuck most of the time and i lose the game.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"till now thiz iz the most addicted game but i suggest if there is slope down.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"can you give us an option to change the tilt sensitivity please.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"it looks so oversized ' can't even play the game .
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"stays at imangi studios and force closes.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"please add sensivity option or fix it otherwise it better than first temple run
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"i love this game but after update it still won't load past the first screen on my lg optimus 3d p920 please fix:)
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"only problem is the poor performance.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"oh ya  the app freeze when i open the privacy button.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"doesn't load, closes out on its own.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"sensitivity is a little off sometimes on my note 2, hopefully this upgrade will fix it.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"while i think this is a great short term time killer, it freezes my phone quite a bit.
",info
lenfortytwo,ratingone,"ok on my tmobile sidekick for droid i can play the 1st temple run but this one it freezes when it is loading i haven't been able to play part 2 and i want too real bad please try to figure it out
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"it constantly lags which makes it impossible to take the corner and jumps.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"i think this is way harder but better graphics and on my phone takes too long to load
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"sometimes it doesn't detect gestures properly.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"lag constantly kills me.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"just keeps force closing plz fix
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"whole screen is filled with icons only please fix it.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"and sometimes i fly off the track after a weird combo of sliding and jumping.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"amazing but after this update it doesn't open, fix please.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"on the galaxy s 4g the game wount start up.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"it says error download ekek aww
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"good graphics but lags game resolution.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"this would be a five if it didn't crash my tablet so much
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"however, so far i have experienced severe lagging (the screen even refreshes sometime while running and i'm popped onto a completely different track).
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"besides the face that when i try to open it often it doesnt open and glitches
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"won't load game now.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"i hag a motorola blur and all i get to is the start up screen even with the new patch it doesn't work
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"great game but sensitivity could have been better
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"great but can't download
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"some time the game hangs.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i bought 50,000 coins and the coin doubler and neither work.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i'm having trouble with the response to my touch on my phone.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"the game will load and then exits automatically.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"for exaple ill jump and it makes me slide.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"changing from 2 to 1 star because of how stupid level 8 missions are.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i would put five stars if montana smith is brought back
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"why not 7500, 10000, 15000, 25000 coins in 1 run?
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingone,"still force closes when i open it i have a samsung infuse the old temple run works but even with the update it still doesn't work i really want to play this so please fix
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingtwo,"i could have given it 5 stars but the guy does not move left n rite fix it i will give u 5 stars i have even uninstalled it twice n installed it again
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"my only problem in playing is i always lag.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"my coin doubler does not work why is that?
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"i really enjoy the game and its a huge improvement but the lag messes with the game play to much.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"it ran perfect at first but then it started lagging bad throughout the game and i always die because of it!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i've finished the 1m meters objective, but it's still there for me to finish.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"maybe it's a result of my finishing one of the objectives when it was shown twice.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"i have put on the new update, i have completed more than 1 million meters but my 1 million metres objective is struck and doesnt move.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"if you're trying to jump a gap, and you hit the edge, it sometimes does a weird thing where you fly to the right or left.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"i can be playing but then run off the cliff because the game lagged and i didn't see it coming.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"but takes too long when i click on the app to play but besides dat, wonderful
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"have trouble sliding sometimes.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"needs tilt option
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"just find the ads irritating
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"i wish that when my battery is dying and the warning comes on the game would pause like in some of my other apps.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"-i cannot see my stats, making it impossible to brag to my friends.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"still skips frames even after update.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i was sooooo bummed that this game came out for the iphone first.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"the designers really hated colors !?!?
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but when the girl dies does she really have to sound so.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"basically the same game as t1, almost nothing new.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"temple run 2 is a excellent game but there's same problem in playing my st15i.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"have an s3 and this game still runs like crap.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"for one is it just me or is this game a bit stiff compared to the first one.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this one is so bright and colourful it makes the obstacles unspottable sometimes.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"really great game but kind of jerky on turns
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"everytime i open it it will show the imangi studios logo for about a minute then it will just slose the app.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"randomized levels add to the replayability.
",info
lentwo,ratingfour,"downloading error
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"i have passed 500.000 in life coins, but the objective progress on passing that limit of coins, is locked on about 50%.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"however it is quite annoying when it goes to -1 on the gems can't it just stay at 0 when you don't have enough gems to save you once dying.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"only hiccup is that the later challenges are almost impossible (10,000,000 lifelong coins. are you kidding me?).
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"game is great, but the crashes are annoying enough to kill the experience.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"considering i can't even download it this is stupid
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"it keeps on freezing when i have a high score
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"i like the game but i wish that when i get multiple objectives on one round,that it would check them all off.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"it wont let me download it.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfive,"only thing is the tilt on tablets on the phone it works perfect but the tilt on tablets is unstable but hey at least we got temple run 2 been waiting a long time for this :d
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"tilt sensitivity s very less wen compared to first version.
",info
lenfortyseven,ratingone,"i like the game its awesome but it lags a lot and slow on my phone and i have android 4.0.4 and a 1.4 processer idk why it does that but its fun other then that and they also take coins away if you don't use them sucks
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"for some reason when i launched the game today, none of my scores were saved, all power ups gone n back to level 1.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"hoping the next update makes the tilts more responsive.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingone,"does not work everytime i try to play it it only loads the ingram sign and then crashes and i have deleted it 2 time and downloaded it 3 time still don't work and this is on the lg thrill
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"focecloses sometimes other than that it's an okay game.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"yeah its great but now it wont even openand when it does it closes but i like graphics
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"when i open this app in android, always load and then exits the app
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"the mineshaft is way too difficult.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"and one suggestion y cnt u try to introduce a boat in d falls like railway track.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"why i can't download this games,,,?
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i very  hard to see waht button ur pressin because there all on top of each other.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"i expect more different levels from temple run3
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"i tried everything and it wont start.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"awesome game played ever  but got slower and get hangs while playing on xperia miro
",info
leneight,ratingone,"it wont open on my lg please fix
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"i have 500000 lt points but the objective isnt cleared.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"explorer sticks to one side abd motion sensor is not working properly after update.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"hey, i really enjoy the original temple run, i would like to play the new one but for some reason it will not pass the starting screen on the lg optimus 3d please fix!
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingtwo,"i love thee game really captive and well crafted but coin denominations change frequently and minor glitches have caused it to crash but overall nice game oh yeah the coins keep resetting!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"now its just stuck there however the 1,000,000 coin achievement is still increasing.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"the game opens with the splash screen, like it's supposed to, but then it freezes, vibrates for a second and the app crashes.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"this game is okay, but every time i pass level 5 and continue, it resets the game to back to level 5 the next day.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"it tends to skip and freeze every now and then.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"every time i open it, it ends up closing right out of it .
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"the objectives given is totally insane.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"its really good and fun etc, but its too easy and some of the objectives aren't reasonable.
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"i had lots of coins and it just all disaperd dont buy if it doning that otherwise good game
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"by far the thing that needs to be fixed most urgently is power up timing.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"temple run 2 is addicting and fun but i had to force close a few times so i uninstalled and installed again :d
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"same issue with coins and the worst thing, the graphics are draggy and jerky.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"i've never gotten a chance  to play it on my phone because it force closes every time !
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"fun game, but sometimes lags
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"i have 1,000,000 life time meters, but the objective isn't updating.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"it won't even work every time i click it it sends me back to my home screen can any one help
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"its fun and addicting, just kinda slow sometimes.
",info
lenthirty,ratingone,"it shuts down automatically after the i screen please fix i really love temple run n i played 2 on my lil sisters ipod n i loved it please please fix
",info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"but the most necessary thing is tilt sensitivity setting for the gameplay.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"wont run on my moto defy not happy
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"does anyone else experience this delay?
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"to slow to donwload
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"don't know whats happing but now when i tilt my phone to any side the character does not tilt with the phone.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"i didn't get the extra coins that i purchased.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"i have samsung galaxy s and i can't even get the game to load it stops at the big i thing this needs to be fixed.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"the game freezes when open it
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingone,"while under the influence of a power up if you get a second power up of the same kind it should extend the time of the power up.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfour,"the gameplay is bit easier now (which i liked about it) but has some glitches of its own, like the player even jumped off the track on left and right.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"but tilting is bad
",info
lensix,ratingone,"force closes at the loading page. :/
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"the game freezes when i am playing and cause my person to die even though she isnt even close to hitting anything.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"great app but it keeps freezing on my g3
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"i will try to play and once on the imangi studios i hear the menu music play but then it just takes me back to my phones home screen ! -_-
",info
lenten,ratingone,"it gets stuck and won't take any screen input.
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"fix the lag issues and you'll get 5 stars
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"it keeps you guessing and plays rather well the one flaw is you cant play laying down it makes leaning under sensitive.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"download it it starts to load then screen goes black then it exits
",info
leneight,ratingone,"all my stats, powers, everything back to zero.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"game is good now, new challenges but definitely lags a lot and hangs after a little long run.
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"it force closes -_-
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"the 1mil lifetime coins is also more than halfway done but still, its stuck at 3rd of the way  :(
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"power meter doesnt increase inside cave.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"it crashes every time before i can even play.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"i want my coins saved!
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"tilt needs to be more than usual to take effect.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"just having problem with tilt sensitivity.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"at least give us a sensitivity setting!
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i hit on the game, and it shows the picture of the ""i"" and then that exits.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"i'm not sure if the forceclosing problem when i beat my high score has been fixed or not seeing as how i haven't beaten my high score since my last review.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"the first time i downloaded it it only load up and it never works.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingthree,"i played the game but initially found that it lags even on a dule core processor which is enough for any game to work on i better like the original temple run.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"shows only spash and close unable to play
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"had it at 5 stars but the newest update seems to misread my slide commands.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"it doesn t work on my galaxy tab it gets to the loading screen and stops i have to force close it all the time! !
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"i downloaded the game and when i try to play it the game goes back to my home screen.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"i pretty much have to tilt my device so far that i almost can't see the screen to keep from falling off into the abyss.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"only problem is i keep losing all my coins & don't know why.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"lil laggy at times  but hard to put down
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"a great game with good graphics., but there is a glitch with 500k coins and pls restart the timer when we pick a powerup of the same kind, before the first one gets over.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"its a very good, but it would be even better if you could add sensitivity in the settings, also its a little laggy at some points whitch gets me pretty mad
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"the game lags n hangs alot right frm d begning f d run in ma walkman live.
