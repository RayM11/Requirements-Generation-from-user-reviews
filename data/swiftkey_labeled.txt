leneleven,ratingfour,"And I want swift key to save the words I type.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"I think it could do with a bit more customization...
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"And a few more settings for example, after I insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after..It would be good to be able to turn that off.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"Also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"I really would like to see Chinese language integration to be developed.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Very annoying to switch with other input methods.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"Does not work with S-Pen on Galaxy Note 2
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"It WAS awesome until the layout was changed.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"It may work for large displays but NOT phones with cases on them!
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"I hate the new slide punctuation bar!
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Bring smaller space bar back!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"You need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database. This way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!!!
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"When your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open SwiftKey.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"Im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for Chinese either,  over rated.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Wish I could customize the layout, then I would give 5 stars.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Awesome keyboard just lags with Google takes forever to show up.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"I like how you did pumpkin for Halloween can we get a Christmas theme.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Because of missing of Macedonian language!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work..
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I also don't like that you can't use swear words.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I'm 23, please let me use what words I want to use.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"I am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"I find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"I have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Also, I should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"If this language/font were to be added, SwiftKey would win the award for best Android app.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"After having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"But very glitchy on Google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key...
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Until I updated to Jelly Bean, I would give this app 5 stars.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"However, following the update on my S3 to Jelly Bean, it now reverts to the Samsung keyboard as the default every time I restart the phone.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"From my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until Jelly Bean is updated to 4.1.2.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"I just need Chinese!!!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"Keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too...
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"Just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"As stated before SwiftKey does not load after a reboot. It has to be disabled an re enable again.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Great keyboard and prediction but needs SWIPE function for portrait mode and better customization
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"Update: Using on the LG Optimus G and the cursor KEEPS  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"But can't personalized with fb..
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"Uninstalled until I can save it to the SD card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"This app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my GS3
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Give me a red version of the ""holo"" theme and you'll get 5 stars.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"The only thing I do hate is when I enter a full stop then  space it automatically In puts (I) so my sentences start with I when I'm typing fast.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"Used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my GS3 it will not hold as default :'-(
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I would love to more themes, the current themes are great but I love customising my phone.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"Wheres the clipboard button?
",info
lensix,ratingone,"This auto correct is illogical sometimes.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"When I type ""just""  I don't mean ""justified"".
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"It will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"Was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my Samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!!
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingtwo,"I don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a Samsung galaxy tablet 10.1
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Please add a few themes frequently.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"I love this keyboard,  but I notice a significant decrease in my battery life when I use it.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"It would be perfect if there was a delete key!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"I would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"As it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Love it but needs emoji support now
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingtwo,"Pretty good,  I get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what I actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Just wish it had more themes.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"One like Holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfive,"I love this app best $3 I've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"The one and only problem I have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"This app is okay except that the keys are loud when I type, so if I'm working or hunting I have to change the settings.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"And if I'm just not finding how to change the setting I apologize but I've looked everywhere on the phone
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Needs more themes!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"Love the "".com""  button but I wish it were in a different place. Maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
",info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"You need more themes..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"It's a great keyboard,  I just get board with the limited options
",info
leneight,ratingone,"It's useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"In the Dvorak layout, the lowercase 'M' & 'W' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press. The 'W' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingone,"This would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the ""com"" button while in a browser renders it nearly useless. Hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"I the only reason I give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"Just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient...
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"1 - The keyboard reverts to the original Android Keyboard every time the USB storage becomes disconnected.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"Every time I hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, I have to re-enable it via the Android OS Settings.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"Great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"Numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"I don't need it suggesting an odometer reading I'll never see again.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"It would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"But could you guys add a swiping option?
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"If I take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"Needs improvement in Arabic language support
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"My only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most Samsung galaxy s3
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"The only weird thing I encountered was on my RAZR while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Amazing app, although I wish there were more themes to choose from.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"It doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"An example is when you type something on Google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"The same happens in some contact names fields such as Gmail, GOSMS Pro, Any.do. Etc.
",info
lenfortyfour,ratingtwo,"I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text...like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3 and way more Update;
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingone,"i have tried to ask if possible to add ""numbers"" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog... but no one answer, nobody care...
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language...
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Just at least one of all the major colors. ESPECIALLY RED!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"It always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, I wish I hadn't paid for this before I knew there was a free version
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Have turned off as does not support pen entered text on Samsung note 2.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"Have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingtwo,"If you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"I want more color fonts
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Why is there no Tab key?
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingthree,"But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The only complaint I do have are a couple of bugs.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"Fatal support for Polish.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I really dislike how it fails to show predictions during Web browser use.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"There are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfour,"Totally annoying when I'm used to typing as best I can and picking predictions from the list. At least please give us the option to turn it on / off.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"The only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"Great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"However, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"It's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type URLs into text messages.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"The only thing I really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"I'm used to typing correctly in the first place so I add the space myself and SwiftKey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"I want to turn predictions completely OFF, but can't?
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"5 stars if could turn off predictions.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Just add emojis and more themes.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Would like S Pen support for Galaxy Note 2 so I don't have to swap when writing documents.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"But the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the Samsung at all..
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"And when I'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.. It hits the. com
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"Whenever I try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together... Why is that?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
",info
lentwo,ratingthree,"Emoji support.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"This keyboard is amazing but the only problem I have with it is that when I use Google drive it slows down and lags SO much.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I just wish they would add swipe
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Would like to see a couple more themes, but I have no complaints as the Holo theme is gorgeous.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"I think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram..
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"A ridiculous amount of RAM!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by Google for nexus.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Loved Swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"A lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"The app also has trouble downloading the language packs ...
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my S3
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"Edit: The keyboard stop predicting when I am in Any.do, Facebook web browser and several other applications that I couldn't remember.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingthree,"Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
",info
lenforty,ratingthree,"However,  every time I close all apps and ram memory and I go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with SwiftKey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"Long story short I have to go change the options to have SwiftKey on every time I want to text.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme For your phone.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Won't start automatically on GS3 however.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"But it is not compatible with 4.1.1  So frustrated.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"Split keyboard does NOT work on the Note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"The keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"Most notably Google now.... it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"I wish there will be more themes added
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Please integrate swype.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Prediction does not work anymore.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"I only wish they had more color scheme.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"I was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did NOT import.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"The settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"Very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Since I updated my S3 to Kelly Bean sometimes SwiftKey is not even activating when I go to text or type.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingone,"I have to exit whatever I'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as I said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ICS.
",info
lenfiftyone,ratingfour,"I love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when I I'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service I thought it was my phone but now I have the note 2 n same thing..
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"I just hate how when I click the 123 icon on the keyboard I hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular S3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Drawback, could do with more skins.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"Great keyboard only issue I have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so I have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"Was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects...
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work...
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"Can't go without this keyboard anymore, though I'd still love to be able to disable gestures
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"It does occasionally stop typing.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Kinda laggy when opening and closing..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"The Arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Can't remember my email address.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Has a problem remembering simple words.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"I used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"Sometimes word prediction doesn't show up. Have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"I would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"English, of course, but with Korea prediction and everything?
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"The beta edition for Thai has been expired. Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"My only flaw is since the jelly bean update if I have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"It works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"But I would love a cleaner looking interface.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"Frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"Resets after boot or restart.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Will not set itself as default keyboard.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"I recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been HORRIBLE.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"The keyboard is horribly laggy.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"I've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Only complaint: no swype mode.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
",info
lennine,ratingone,"Due to error 941 this is bs. Cannot refund either
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Wouldn't install on my gs3
",info
lenten,ratingone,"I just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"It does not install. Error 941
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"I enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words I put in.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"And I'd like to see more, newer themes.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"The only thing that I can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"Bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"As mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"I sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"They updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly. How about a few more?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"It would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"But after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"But since I root my phone, I constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"It feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
",info
lenfiftynine,ratingthree,"I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"Predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Spell check randomly stops working.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"Prediction will sometimes turn off when I sleep the phone.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Need S-Pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
",info

lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"This work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until I pull the battery
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"Just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"Just add swype pleeease
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is I can not use swype as on the Samsung keyboard.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"SK3 was working flawlessly until the AT&T JB update for S3 recently came out.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingtwo,"When locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.

leneleven,ratingtwo,"Will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingthree,"I would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys. And when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the Samsung keyboard.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"(I still hope for some hearts :D)
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I do wish it supported Japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"It doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"Would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, I'd really like a quieter option!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
",info
lentwentythree,ratingtwo,"Used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the Swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with Android jelly bean.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"As much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone. Crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"But I wish it used less memory!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"The word ""it's"" is almost impossible and always comes out as ""is"".

",info
leneight,ratingfour,"Please integrate learning from WhatsApp Messenger as well.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"At the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Sometimes wish it had more themes though.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"Only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"However the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Often times when I hit the ""A"" key I hit the shift key.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"I can't download the language pack. It's the same error over and over again.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Good app but the Turkish dictionary is very insufficient. It doesn't contain many basic words.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"I request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, Google and Facebook.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Suggested words were never accurate either.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"It's good but I'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"The best,no s-pen detection?
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"where is handwriting for s pen?
",info
lensixtythree,ratingfive,"My only issue with this and it's a SERIOUS issue with me is that since I got the update for my S III to 4.1 is that I can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when I type. The phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what I do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"would love more themes!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"But, it's been almost a year and I think one new theme was added!
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Come on guys... Get on board the theme wagon!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"This by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to JB, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"As mentioned by others, Google search has slowed with the keyboard not appearing for several seconds when using this keyboard.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"I have had this keyboard since I first got the Evo, I just love it, I wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!

",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"I'd still like an editable dictionary of the words that it has learned.

",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"After updating to jb, there is no heptic intensity control. It's always full blast.

",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Just improve the polish and french dict. :-)
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"This keyboard was stunning on my old Galaxy Ace2 but I now use Galaxy S3 mini running Jelly Bean 4.1 and now Swiftkey will not work.

",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Regretably had to un-install.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"The swipe down gesture to minimize the keyboard doesn't work very well.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"we need more themes!! like a red and green one for Christmas!!
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"or color personalization
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!!
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"And I don't want to type in landscape.
",info

",info
lenfortyone,ratingfive,"Have noticed a bug with it though (although not sure if this is a bug with the keyboard or with android), whenever my phone runs out of battery or I restart it for any reason, the keyboard defaults to Samsung Keyboard.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"After turning on phone keyboard does not load. Have to go into settings and choose again.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"It misses the hinglish language support.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"It still lags on viber but over all it is amazing but yeah when is SwiftKey Flow coming to this app or making a new one the is the flow version??
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"Issue 1: I don't use smileys!! Please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Issue 2: Alt keys layout. Couldn't you just set it out like EVERY OTHER KEYBOARD ON THE MARKET!?
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"I want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  I want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen. At least give the option to your users.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"This keyboard is amazing for English but it doesn't have a Japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The only 'complaint' is that the themes are quite awful.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"When I'm on Facebook I only get the keyboard. No auto correct or word - guess - er.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"Also when I finish a word at the end of a line I can't insert a space bar??
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the Chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Slow to minimize on JB Maxx HD update, the functionality however destroys ics/jb keyboard.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Awesome keyboard needs more haptic feedback and it will be perfect.

lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Waiting for chinese support, it's amazing to try this kind of input.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"It would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Can you add traditional Chinese?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"The keyboard is now running slow, freezes  takes a while to open and close...
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I love everything about the app except for one thing, I wish there were more theme options.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"I have a galaxy note and the swiping feature doesn't work..
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"Love the keyboard but its really slow now
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"When I changed it back to the samsung galaxy keyboard it stopped.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"The only complaint is have is that there isn't a customized dictionary.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"It doesn't predict words I use all the time
",info
lenten,ratingone,"Pls update thai language im waiting for the long time
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"I deducted one star, however, because it causes crashes with some regularity.
",info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"Needs another simultaneous dictionary.
",info
lentwo,ratingtwo,"Annoying censorship.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"I can understand censoring explicit swearing but words like ""gay"", ""horny"" or ""sex"" get changed into something else.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"""Erection"" gets go changed into ""election"" although the letters aren't even near.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Also, apparently, dictionaries not too complete.
",info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"""Egyptian"" doesn't exist.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Writing in Portuguese is a pain.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"since the update when i type, it puts random periods and wrong text.
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingone,"I get an error message when I try to install the language pack that says there is a problem with the network connection, make sure your network connection is working, then try again.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"I think the problem may be that this new version of the Note is running Jelly Bean.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"I see that some others running Jelly Bean are also experiencing problems.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"If got Chinese input I will give you 5 star.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Hope faster get Chinese input!!
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"Were need Chinese input!!!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"Normal typing just doesn't cut it any more.
",info
lenfortyone,ratingfive,"Normally I would give it only four stars because there are still a few very minor bugs that need ironing out from a power user perspective, but this app is one of the key selling points for Android, in my opinion.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingthree,"Why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button? With a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"Why does it learn from everything except whatsapp?
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, I like my S3 stock keyboard layout more.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Back to 3 stars until they add an option to disable the key popup !!!
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"My only slight annoyance is when the "".com"" key appears. I wish there was an option to hide it, I seem to press it on accident often.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Also, why does SwiftKey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"After upgrading to Jelly Bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed...
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"I purchased this app because it simply awesome but after I movedto jellybean it'sshowing error crashes and copy and paste optionsare disabled.
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"More themes..?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Works perfect but for some reason it lags when I exit the typing mode.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"Only thing is that if you screw up the last word of a text message and hit send it doesn't fix that last word before sending..
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Please make it fix the last word when we hit send.....
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Could use an update for better keys on 7 inch tablets  Like my nexus 7
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"Im one of those people who depend on auto correct and it never works.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"Good keyboard but ''percentage'' symbol missing and not very good performance...
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Thanks forbalways adding words when i hit the space bar and for always learning the wrong way to spell words.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Would love to see more themes though!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"but no compact QWERTY option which I think is essential in portrait view
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Not compatible with jelly bean.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Resets after boot or restart.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"more themes would be appreciated dev.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"Please please please revert back to a seperate ""!"" button like in the old version of swiftkey.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"I press ""!"" ""?"" and ""."" way more often than the letter ""q"". It deserves its own place. 1 button for 3 common keys?
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR ""!"" AND ""?""!!!
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfive,"One thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as I am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes I prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The only thing I would add is more customisation options!
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"This app is very good w/ English  But Arabic layout is very annoying, Please use Windows layout instead of MAC
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"But why does it take up 27 MB of RAM on my Galaxy Nexus?
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"The more RAM programs use the less program you can run EFFICIENTLY, slowing down the phone in general.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfour,"Often I notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up RAM for no reason and have to uninstall the Hogs. This is similar to the memory leak problem Firefox has on the desktop.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Arabic letters are rather small
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"but uses good amount of ram in background.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"It's a decent keyboard replacement but I feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"For example typing lowercase free standing ""i"" isn't auto capitalized, typing ""whats"" isn't auto corrected to ""what's"" and so on.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"It also takes a lot of memory.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"Sometimes its a bit freaky how predictable this is.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"Just wish it had more themes.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"But frequently it does weird things when trying to type on the Web.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"(Dolphin) Frequently when entering text in a field it repeats the first key press instead of typing the letters I am pressing.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"It would be nice if it had some options to take advantage of the huge screens that are coming out.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"Good but please have a save to see card option I payed 4 bucks for this and I takes up a lot of space.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"But would like to see more colors please!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of ram
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Jelly Bean resets Swiftkey when the phone is restarted.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Any chance to add Chinese language?
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Just wish you could swipe also
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"Main problem prediction (lithuanian).
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Would be more stars if there was possibility to turn off the prediction.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Now it seems to be making up its own words and not correct anything even when I have cleared the language data.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"It needs a number row like the stock note keyboard
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"When I use this keyboard on my gs3 it is very unresponsive and laggy.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Only complaint is the amount of RAM needed and the delay that occurs when closing the keyboard after hitting the home button.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I will support you if you add support for Japanese language.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"It kinda annoys me that it has persian (who in the world speaks persian) and not such a widely known language as Japanese.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"More themes please.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Only request is for a collapse keyboard button. Sometimes buttons like that are just needed.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"Time for more themes thank u
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Love it, all it needs is more themes.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"I'll give 5 stars when the Jellybean issue is fixed.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"I want to see performance increased for the Samsung Galaxy S3.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"All the app really lacks is more themes.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"Good keyboard but, can we disable the prediction?
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"Once the swype features are added it'll be unrivalled!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Just wish you had more themes or ability to make a custom theme.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"I dont know what the dev thought when he decided to ask for email and facebook access (major security concern).
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"The app is supposed to allow y to delete mistaken words you don't want in the language model.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingtwo,"I press and hold the prediction, and there is no option to delete! It's really annoying because common typos then become predictions
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"After reboot im locked back into the Samsung keyboard, help me it is already set for default
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"But the only downside is that since jellybean update its constantly ""forget"" the default keyboard selection...
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Overall product quality is very good except it's user defined library doesn't work with whatsapp.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Because of whatsapp issue I can just give 3 stars...
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"My only concern is that when entering emails the app needs to recognize that you are doing so and needs to adjust accordingly (eithout automatically spacing after periods, auto capatilizing letters for certain email addresses).
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"But really bad performance on 4.1.
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"Hangs often and really slow button response.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"The only issue I have is that it is slow to start up at times in most apps.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"Please fix the slow start up times and this is a perfect keyboard!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"I love this keyboard but have started having an issue after upgrade to Jelly Bean.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"The Predictions row gets turned off each time I wake the screen if the keyboard was open when the screen goes to sleep.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"If I close the keyboard and reopen, predictions come back.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Let's get some more themes now! ;-)
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"Certainly the best for typing, the only thing I would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"As petty as it sounds I would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"All we need is Chinese input (I prefer strokes)
",info
lensix,ratingone,"No word prediction in various browsers.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"No dedicated # row option either.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"If only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"SwiftKey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a Chinese input..
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"If they could integrate a bit of slide like FlexT9 it would be unbeatable.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"Auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Can't even get it for the default browser.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Also, when I have the keyboard enabled, it for some reason disables the handwriting feature in the Samsung Keyboard for the Note 2
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"I like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"More themes!
",info
leneight,ratingone,"I can download any language except for English.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"**still not saving any new words!!
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"Seems to have totally forgotten a lot of my saved words.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"Also if I type too fast it just deletes the word and I have to type it again.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Changed to three stars because it loves the battery.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Cut my S III's battery time almost in half.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"EXELENT BUT NO WWW
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"My only gripe is that when I hit close to the 'i'  key I sometimes hit the 'u' key instead,  and i never use u for you so this bothers me.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"It doesn't support one hand operation which is so essential for the giant screen of Note 2.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"I use the swipe on android and this keyboard  dont have it
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"I don't like how laggy it can be sometimes.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"It is especially bad when I switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"I also have speed issues when I'm touch typing like I would on the normal android keyboard.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"But PLEASE add swipe right as a redo. (swipe left deletes a word,  so swipe left undoes that deletion).
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I often find myself accidentally deleting words...
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Its take so much time for pop up and its typing speed is slow
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"The predictions don't show up and it won't auto correct my words.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"My version has a few misspelled words that it automatically displays in the predictions window. Cannot edit the dictionary to remove them.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"SmartSpace is terrible, unadjustable, and too invasive.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"FYI: SwiftKey doesn't like the Moto LapDock at all.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"Certain behaviors like automatic spacing after periods are a pain in the @$$ when trying to type in my email address that has periods in it.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"An option that disables automatic spacing after punctuation is necessary.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I would also like to see an option to edit the personal dictionary.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Its a great keyboard however I wish it suppoerted the samsung swipe.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"As mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Bug: when typing words beginning with a capital letter on Firefox, that word won't be written
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"And plz provide new themes.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Sometimes the auto predict won't even come up when you're texting/typing.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"Some of the minor problems I have with it are the fact that the keyboard wants to insert an I if you hit enter after a period.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I like the fact that it can predict my words but I rarely start a sentence with I.
",info
lenforty,ratingfour,"Also some of the words it will allow me to type and won't correct are some of the most mispelled words, although there are only a handful and the keyboard will learn which words you use and don't.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"I love this keyboard, but since updating to 4.2.1, I've got performance issues.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"First, the keyboard takes too long to show up  second, the keyboard lags when typing rapidly (it used to be buttery smooth).
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Would have been great to receive the incompatibility warning PRIOR to paying.
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"It keeps inserting words I don't want.
",info
lentwo,ratingone,"Limited dictionary.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"Costs me way more effort than the std keyboard because I have to go back constantly to correct.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Just little niggles like not working correctly in Chrome like user name and captchas.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"Emoji support would be awesome please.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"This is an outstanding app and I would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) Swipe functionality and (2) More keyboard themes.
",info

",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I can't fix typos often when I already have typed other words.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"I'll go back to fix it and when I press the backspace button, it adds chucks of words instead of erasing.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"Also, when typing in all capitals, the auto correct is very bad. Especially the first one.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"Rarely has a hiccup, but some keys I'd rather have on the main board.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"Speaking of which though, I wish there was Japanese and Chinese available so I don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Please add more themes
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Great app but you lose the ability to add standard Samsung characters, like the hearts for example.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Also no personal dictionary.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"What about being able to learn from whatsapp as I do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"We also need Italian keyboard layout
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I gave it a 4 because I thought it would have more color customization.

lenthree,ratingone,"Need Thai language
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"Dude where are the themes!??
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"When I just had the trial version the app worked like a charm but now it freezes from time to time for no apparent reason.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"I am forced to exit the program and start over from the beginning-sending emails is even worse - in landscape view it is almost impossible to see what you are writing
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that we can't type in Chinese!!!
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingfour,"I mean, there's even languages I have never heard of, but not Chinese mandarin...oh and another, at times it doesn't automatically autocorrect and a word such as ""gjakdn"" will pass
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"Tle letter for arabic keyboard is small very difficult to write

",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I commonly have the problem that it will not do predictions in landscape mode.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"Need a button to toggle predictions.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Now it's just like any other keyboard, not keeping my regularly used terms in its dictionary.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"It's lacking customisation to make it efficient enough to compete with Swype which makes touch typing feel like swimming.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"The auto correction is totally busted(makes you write like a retard)
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"The setup is overly complicated and confusing.

",info
lenfiftyfour,ratingfour,"I have noticed that the standard Samsung keyboard method will come back every now and then and I have to swipe to get the notification center and change back to ""SwiftKey 3"" from ""Samsung keyboard"" on my Galaxy S3. It will happen every time I restart the phone and then try to text or anything else.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.

lentwentythree,ratingfour,"I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook. It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"The only problem I have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating -
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"It doesnt work with fb chat... which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"the only improvement that SwiftKey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the Samsung keyboard and hold the 123? Button to paste.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"The keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much...
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"If I just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email...

lensix,ratingtwo,"There is a ton if lag!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"I start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and I've already written a paragraph.

",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"When I use the multitasking multi windows, the SwiftKey keyboard stays the same size when in the Samsung keyboard it gets smaller and the keyboard Window is able to be moved around.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"One fault could be the lack of personal dictionary as it doesn't allow you to save words you use the most etc other than that it's brilliant.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"Would rate this 5  if it  had Japanese language.

lentwelve,ratingtwo,"I saw the update but disappointed to see no Japanese input yet.

",non-info

",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"I really love the keyboard,  I came from and iPhone and it's been quite the easy switch because of SwiftKey.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"It's quite annoying,  and also the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Make an option to toggle this setting,  please!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"The only app I have ever purchased and it is worth every penny.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I was addicted to swype on my galaxy note but this blows it out the water......
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Bought paid version because like the direction arrows at bottom of keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"There is nothing negative about this app that I can find or see.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"So much better then default or any other app iv tried
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I was a little skeptical that one keyboard would be any better than another keyboard.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I been using the standard DROID keyboard that came with the phone.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I thought a keyboard was just a keyboard... Wrong!!!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"From the second I am started typing on SwiftKey 3 I was amazed at how much quickly I got comfortable with it.

lenfive,ratingfive,"Sorry, can only give 5 stars.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"It's a great keyboard! :-)
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"This app has saved me over 10k keystrokes according to its statistics since I bought it 4 months ago!
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Once I got used the to the interface I really don't know how I could live without it now!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Not so good compare to SwiftKey 1. Or maybe it's this Samsung galaxy 3 I'm using.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"Had SwiftKey 1 with my HTC Desire hd the SwiftKey keyboard appeared with the prediction bar when I'm on the Internet browser.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Samsung swipe keyboard used to be great on S1.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Useless now on S3 so bought this app.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Next word prediction is spooky -  almost predicts the entire sentence!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingthree,"Really makes my phone sluggish whilst installed
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I was surprised at how well this keyboard worked.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Predictions and accuracy are second to none.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I got this during one of the holiday discounts but I would have gladly paid full price.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"No problems, quick to learn, and will learn how you type.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"SwiftKey word predictions is amazing.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"What I love the most is that it learns the words in my own language that I typed.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"My local words also appear as predictions.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every cent.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I love to text quickly and sometimes I make small errors in keystrokes.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"This keyboard corrects and predicts my text perfectly.
",non-info

",non-info
lentwo,ratingone,"Money sucker.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I love this app!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Perfect to replace the crappy auto correct that comes with the S3.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Been using since beta, best keyboard app out there with this release.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Puts the stock autocorrect to shame! !
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Well worth the money to upgrade.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"This keyboard works amazingly well!
",non-info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"It's making me a lazy texter as I don't have to get many letter right in a word for it to correct it correctly, it works better than anything I've ever tried.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Been looking for a new keyboard with more options.... This one was it!!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"No complaints for this keyboard.
",non-info

lenseven,ratingfour,"fix that and you would reach perfection!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"definitely perfection!
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I'm faster on this than I am on my computer, in fact in took me a couple seconds to write this.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I find that I can type without looking at the keyboard which is amazing.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"trust me money well spent.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It freaky how it knows what you want type.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I want it work on my lap top same way!
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"I haven't used this keyboard in awhile due to being satisfied with the jellybean keyboard on my galaxy nexus, however since getting the RAZR M I've started to look for alternatives and stopped at SwiftKey.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Can't wait for SwiftKey flow.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The new flow option is also awesome.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"You won't regret it!
",non-info
lenten,ratingthree,"without that, you might be left behind in the race.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"The developer knows about it, but doesn't do anything about it!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingone,"So, I downloaded the trial app and fell in love with this setup over my factory SIII keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"I used until trial period ran out, then purchased the app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Downloaded to make life easier, not so much.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Better than default keyboard
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"The best app I have downloaded.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"As nice as the original SwiftKey was the new slide is way, way better!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Word predictions are good.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Waiting for SwiftKey Flow to get a full release!
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"It would be better if these things are fixed, but i can live without those problems getting in my way.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Still 5 stars, good job devs!
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"3 stars for your best work and another 2 will be given to you after fulfillment of my demands
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"It fixes all my mistakes and even knows what I am about to write.

",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Awesome app works perfect
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"When this app actually comes up on my screen when I go to type something I love it.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Only app ive ever spent money on and ever reviewed for that matter, but this app is worth it.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Keyboard works really well, especially for those who type quickly.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Literally memorizes how u usually respond to people.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"All around a great upgrade from the regular keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"There is a reason its the top paid app in the app store.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"My typing speed has increased considerably with this app and making less mistakes.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I type in English and Spanish and the app makes accurate predictions on both languages simultaneously.

lenfourteen,ratingfive,"The application is amazing and seriously I am twice as fast when I text.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Makes swype obsolete.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I have bigger thumbs and even though the keys look smaller they work much better even if your fingers touch other keys.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"It does know how you text people and it gives you some great auto corrects.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Great keyboard for typing fast.
",non-info
lensix,ratingtwo,"I use to live this app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I try a lot of different keyboards.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I loved swype but this is even better.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"It's a very good idea and app, but the smarter it got, the Mora annoyed I've got.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"It's awesome no regrets
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Flipping amazing keyboard that just knows what you are going to type.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"Makes the whole point of the tablet version redundant.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Use Thumb Keyboard instead - at least it delivers what it promises.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Swiftkey is a waste of money, developers unresponsive
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Easy to use, great features set, brilliant
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It really helps me typing fast without many errors

lenfive,ratingfive,"The auto correct is flawless!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I am very happy satisfied with this keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Don't even get me started on the predictive text!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Other than that I love this app
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"This app lays waste to all built in or aftermarket keyboards.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"It's customizable, and it learns your writing style, and vocabulary, and the predictions are on the spot from the very beginning.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"At least try the free version, but either way you will not be displeased.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I never spend money on apps...ever.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"This one was an exception because I was blown away.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This app makes my keyboard use so much easier.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Try it, buy it, just get it.

lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Makes typing a breeze on my HTC Explorer which has a small screen.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"The team is very responsive to any issues.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"I love SwiftKey.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"This keyboard has made my texting on a touch phone really easy and fast!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Sometimes I don't even need to edit what I type cause this app corrects it for me!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I have tried the free trial at first, figuring the trial might end.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"So I bought the app when it was on a promotion for just 99 cent!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Original price is 3.99!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"It is extremely frustrating.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingone,"Galaxy Note 2.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I absolutely love this keyboard app.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Other than that, top rated keyboard.
",non-info

",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommended!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"The best keyboard I've tried, shortens my texting time greatly

lenfour,ratingone,"Huge waste of money!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Galaxy S3 with sprint.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I'm typing this reviwy blazing fast right now!
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"I used the trial version for a month.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"It learned my typing style and i had my settings tweaked perfectly.
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Lots of people complain that the program inputs a space after a period automatically. I complained about it too until i got use to not having to input spaces.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Now this program is saveing me hundreds of keystrokes a week.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"And a must have app for the galaxy s3 which has no autocorrect.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Literally bought this after sending ONE text with the trial version.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"I questioned never getting a touch smart phone again because of how much time I waste just trying to get the terrible Samsung keyboard to write what I want; problem solved!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It's so much faster to swipe to type!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Still it blows every other keyboard out of the water.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I like it's ability to predict what I'm writing.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Nicer, bigger keyboard, better predictions.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Definitely my favouritekeyboard in  landscape format
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard I have ever seen and used!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I've had it for quite a while now, it is worth the few bucks you have to pay for it.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I know I wouldn't text without it!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I type interchangeably between english and spanish, and it is absolutely SEAMLESS.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"I just keep my keyboard in qwerty(espa?ol), and the only difference this makes is when you hold down vowels you can get accents, and there is one extra button (?).
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"I can actually switch languages mid sentence (without having to change a setting or push a button or anything) and it will start predicting and correcting in that language.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Its language detection is amazing, and never gets in your way.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Keep it up dev team!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"A well deserved number 1 app on Android.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Only stayed on the free version for 2 hours and had to purchase.

",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Favorite keyboard.
",non-info

",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This is the only app I have ever bought.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I first downloaded the free trial but once that ran out, I had to have the full version.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"It predicts not only words but sentences.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Not a big deal for me but it looks bad when someone's watching my phone.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The predictions are depressingly accurate.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The interface and special key layout are the best I've seen.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Easy to use, the more you use it the better it gets.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Please fix! RAZR M, JB 4.1.1.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"EDIT: After several reboots and deleting app data, sk3 seems to be stable again.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Frustrating since I had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so I'm happy.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Also very useful for polyglot people (no need to switch languages ever again)
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Hmmm.......Guess the app is that good
",non-info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"Stock keyboard, just as good.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"We waited months for 4.1 and it's impossible to tell how long it will take to get 4.2 especially for international users.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingthree,"Everyone here paid good money for the app please look for a work around other then waiting for 4.2 to be released only then will I give it 5 stars.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"The two stars that are missing reflect developer involvement to solve a known issue.

lenfour,ratingfive,"I love this application
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"Not only does it predict what I say from SMS & Gmail very well but I love the press & hold character feature, saves so much time instead OF switching screens.

",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Do it a lot easier to type in and the prediction engine is amazing!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I don't always use this keyboard, I much prefer Swype for one handed use when I'm on the go.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"But SwiftKey is extremely useful for two handed use
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I downloaded this app hoping for an escape from the horrendous Galaxy S3 default keyboard.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I got far more than I expected.
",non-info

",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I recommend this to all my android-using friends.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Totally worth it.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Multilingual support and amazing predictive ability (seriously -  sometimes I don't even need to type!).

",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I love this app!
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I recently got a Galaxy S3 and I thought I would never be able to type well on a touch screen... Until SwiftKey!
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"It makes it so much easier to type quickly and the predictive texting is really handy when I can't use two hands to type.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's saved me so much time and I have yet to notice a bug or glitch!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"But as it is I am more than pleased.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"First app I load on any new Android including my Nexus 4.

",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"very smart and very fast with predictions. definitely a must download app!

lenfourteen,ratingone,"I have contacted the developers about this problem and they were nothing but useless!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"No help what so ever, they came off as if they did not believe me.
",non-info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"It is a real shame because the application had great potential but when developers do NOT keep up with bugs, it goes down hill very fast.

",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"I love this keyboard, it has ruined me for other mobile devices and even my pc keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard I've used on Android.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"My favorite feature is that the period, comma, exclamation mark, and question mark all share the same key (with the period key as primary).
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Numbers are available on their own alternate keyboard with a rich number of other symbols as well.

",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This is a great keyboard, it works very well.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Worth the several bucks for sure!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Better than the ios keyboard this is well worth the money as more features eg different keyboard sizes.

lensix,ratingfive,"Best keyboard I've ever used.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"It really is crazy how good it is at guessing what you're typing.
",non-info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"From a die hard swype user that was crushed when he got the DNA and saw how bad HTC's slide keyboard is, this is well worth your money. A++

lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It makes typing a lot easier great app very satisfied :)
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I never rate an app but this one I had to!

lenthirteen,ratingfour,"So happy I found this app and then purchased it while on Sale.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"Way better than the stock gs3 keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Probably the best App I have ever bought, Android or OIS...
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I generate whole texts with only ever pushing a few keys.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Intuitive responses that are so accurate, it makes me question if this App is actually programmed using Black Magic and Virgin Sacrifices...
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Gave the trial a go and found it far superior to the stock app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"So I bought it, brilliant and intuitive.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I really love this keyboard!

",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"buy this app five stars worth every penny.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Super easy and simple.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"This is my favorite app and it works very well with the exception of one thing.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I just installed Swiftkey Flow Beta and it also works swimmingly but with the same caveat.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Now this is what you call an app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Fantastic,have made my life heck lot easier.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Typing was never so easy nor fun, but thank to developer, it is.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Messaging, email, chatting they all are so good now.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Would recommend it to everybody, jus buy and leave that one pizza for a day.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"U won't regret.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"A request to Google, please incorporate this in the next android update.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"If there's only one app you need to buy, this is definitely it.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"So, I downloaded the trial app and fell in love with this setup over my factory SIII keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I used until trial period ran out, then purchased the app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"Downloaded to make life easier, not so much.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Have been using it for the past one year.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"The latest version, makes it the best keyboard in the market right now.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Proven again why you chaps are the best in the market.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Typing with pleasure, should be your new motto.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Great work guys.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Best keyboard App
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"This keyboard just keeps getting better and better, if you are debating the purchase, I can't recommend this enough.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"It has the most customization compared to any of the other ones I have tried (Swift, Stock, Hackers...)
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Well worth whatever price they are asking.
",non-info
leneight,ratingtwo,"...but after last update it's total crap!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"I'm using Croatian layout and we used to have Croatian letters underneath regular i.e. long press.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"If you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ? is under z, etc) please refund me.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"I'm sorry for one star, but this is completely your fault.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Even in this version without flow.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Now this app becomes completely useless.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"First, flow is amazing.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great job.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"One thing I'm confused on how to do is write words like 'too' using the flow method.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Every time I try it comes out with only one 'o'.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I've tried moving my finger in circles on the O key but I can't get it to work.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Anyone found a way to solve this problem???
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Its really annoying and it's my only complaint!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Been using this keyboard for ages, best keyboard on Android.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I was skeptical that this could learn from previous texts,  but it really does.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Even silly terms that I use with family members are picked up on.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Great replacement to the stock keyboard, love the predictions it saves a lot of typing for me.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I would kill for this keyboard.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is simply the best keyboard on android, and the new flow is even better.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"The default keyboard on my phone is alright, but a friend told me to try this out.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"It is much better than the standard keyboard on my Xperia S.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"The auto correct is a god send and the predictions can make some pretty good sentences.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Worth the small price tag for a great app.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Don't think I can ever use another on screen keyboard again
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"It auto corrects when I think it should have already learnt a word.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I was a Droid 2 Global user, because of the ""real"" keyboard...
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"And switched to a virtual one...
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"It was terrible, as i have big thumbs, and kept typing the wrong letters...
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Swiftkey saved my cellphone experience!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This is the absolute best keyboard I've tried!!!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"The only thing stopping this keyboard being the perfect Android keyboard are these two issues.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Tried it, liked it, bought it, love it.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It's like I never gave up my full keyboard
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Simply amazing!!!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"It's a great keyboard, and the upcoming Flow option is great!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"Not the worst or unbearable, but just not great.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"The Flow line looks very nice, almost looks out of place
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Ok so I'm an avid Swype guy but love SwiftKey's predictive text.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The beta of Flow is truly brilliant.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"Being able to mix multiple languages so easily together with the great and accurate predictions makes this my favourite app on Android, hands down.

lentwo,ratingfive,"Amazing application.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"The very best keyboard app i've ever used

",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"Not going to lie, should be 5 stars.

lenfourteen,ratingfive,"This app my texts have immediately improved I am amazed by the word predictions.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I was a iphone user.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"In the past two weeks I've could easily switch!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Worth every penny when the trial ended!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Prediction is the best and does not try to correct most text lingo when you need a message to be short!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Best keyboard, period.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Awesome keyboard I don't think that there is a better keyboard.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Just downloaded SwiftKey Flow Beta as I've use and loved SwiftKey for a long time.

lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"The default Samsung Galaxy S3 keyboard was driving me crazy - I was making tons of typos everywhere, much more so than when I had an iPhone.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Since switching to SwiftKey 3, all those typos are history \o/
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"It makes typing so much easier to type.

",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Took a bit to get used to the slider but I don't even notice anymore and LOVE the new pink theme!....
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Freakishly accurate at times.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I'm really looking to the flow update to go with it.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great app.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Way better than the default keyboard
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Much better than the standard Samsung keyboard!!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Predictive text works a lot better and more efficiently.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Best keyboard I've used, and it learns super fast!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I also like the fact that it includes arrows for easy navigation through the text I've typed.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I had heard good things about it from other people, but it has been waaaay better than I expected it to be.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Works better than all the other keyboards I've used.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I'm now using the Flow beta.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I bought this app last night and I've already bought it for two friends.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"As others have said, the predictive text is amazingly accurate.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Before using SwiftKey 3, I cursed the ""auto-text / auto-speller"" on every phone I've owned.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Also, the shortcuts for entering punctuation and emoticons are big time-savers.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"And so far, the voice-to-text feature has been just as great.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Maybe the best $4 I've spent in years.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"No other keyboard even comes close to this one.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Tried living without it for a few days, but I gotta have it back.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Personally, its thebest keyboard in the market!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Keep up th good work devs!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Easily one of the best keyboards I've used!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"I paid for this app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"I would give it negative stars if I could
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"This is an amazing app.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I am now writing my books on my phone because of this.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I can type so much faster now.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I was skeptical at first but this is by far the fastest and most accurate keyboard I have EVER used.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"I wish I would have bought this long ago.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The prediction is spot on.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I came from an iOS background and dealt with that horrendous typing experience for years.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Then I got an android phone, and I was impressed with the stock keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"This, however, blows stock out of the water and into the frying pan.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"The word suggestions are by far the best feature (and it actually works, unlike autocorrect) but being able to long-tap for extra characters is really useful too.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Truly awesome.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"By far the best keyboard on Android.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Google needs to put in a bid for this company.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Seriously, make this a permanent Android feature.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It's saved me over 100,000 keystrokes since installation earlier this year.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Highly recommend this.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Can't wait for swiftkey flow... swype typing is coming and from this developer it'll be great
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"I paid 4$ for this app less then a month ago.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"They should refund people's money.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"25 cent sell, slap in the face to all that paid full price.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"This app makes testing fun and not a hassle.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"The app appears to be reading my mind about the next words I want to type.
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"I had this the Editor's Choice version of this app installed on the Samsung Galaxy Note i717 running Ice Cream Sandwich and it worked beautifully.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"Yesterday I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note II (SGH-1317).
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"I have tried installing and uninstalling this app on my new phone since I bought it yesterday afternoon with no luck.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"However, my network connection is working just fine.
",non-info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"I tried every app on the phone that requires a network connection to see if there was a problem on any other app.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"I even tried watching an episode of something on Netflix.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingone,"When I had this app installed on my Samsung Galaxy Note i717, I would easily have given it five stars.
",non-info
lennine,ratingone,"I hope the problem will be fixed very soon.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"Swiftkey, please comment or advise.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"You're a very good app SwiftKey, but I had to uninstall you.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I'm leaving you for SwiftKey flow!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Quite simply the fastest and best keyboard available
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Was sceptical that this new keyboard could do anything that my stock keyboard couldn't and the price tag did not help.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I am quite surprised at this app, well pleased and 100x better than the stock android keyboard.
",non-info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"This is a great keyboard though I hope they make people who brought this upgrade to swift key flow for free since I'm now using the beta version and I am loving it now...
",non-info
lenfortytwo,ratingfive,"I am crap at spelling and grammar and this does it all for me is learning how I speak in txt and my txt, emails are getting faster and faster this app is the dogs bollocks and worth every penny and more
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Just tried out the beta flow version of this app and I am pleased.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Can't wait for it to come out of beta.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Gonna be the best keyboard in the play store without a doubt
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Great app, much better keyboard than Samsung's effort.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's like an improved keyboard from my old HTC Desire, which was hard to fault anyway.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Had a little trouble upgrading from the trial but I got a swift response (5 minutes!) in my email which sorted everything.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"5 stars well deserved.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Cool its a great app
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"When I return to my desktop, iOS devices, anything else, I want the auto-completion SwiftKey provides.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"It's elementary and ridiculous.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"I don't like it.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"So I downloaded and bought Swiftkey3 and I love it.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"I just downloaded Swift key flow and it is amazing if it gets good reviews and can buy it I highly recommend you do
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Anything else is ok.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Worth the low price and I'm cheap
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Best keyboard out there Imo.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Used to be the best - now stock us better and quicker.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It's actually the best keyboard currently for Android.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Much much better than the original keyboard.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I can completely misspell a word and it figure out what it's supposed to be.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"This is hands down the greatest keyboard on a phone iv ever used.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Otherwise I'm never typing wth anything else ever again haha cheers..
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"At first, I had a difficult time in learning about, how to type with this.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"But after going through with the settings, I saw that there is an option to let this software read through my sms', emails', tweets' content, and identify patterns.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Now I don't have to type, 'Honey,  I'm on my way'.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I just have to type, hon and honey with capital letters H appears.
",non-info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"I just have to tap on it, and one by one other wordings of I'm on my way home appears, and all I have to do then is, tap on each of them.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"No longer will I be making ridiculous typos like in the title of the this review!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Only been using this app for a day but I'm VERY impressed!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"I've never typed so fast on a phone before and I've got a lot of practice!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Wish I had bought this earlier!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingthree,"Feels sluggish sometimes...
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Holy hwll this is more annoying than anything.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"By far the best keyboard app ever!
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"Coming from a full qwerty slider, this app has relieved most of my annoyance with having to type on a touchscreen.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Its ability to make predictions for several languages simultaneously is a big deal, and missing in most competing products.
",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"This is a brilliant app for predicting words etc....
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"This app is a must have I make sure I have it installed on every android phone I get.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Always remembers everything i wrote before
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"It's so awesome how well the prediction is.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"In fact, you can get rid of the keys altogether and just have one big pad.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"We all know what the keyboard layout is.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Much better than any stock keyboard.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Its prediction and auto correct are much better than any other keyboard I've used, stock or not.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"But I'm still going to rate this keyboard 5 stars.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"It's simply the best keyboard around and I love that you can change themes, keeps everything feeling fresh.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I heard 4.1.2 update fixes the default keyboard issue so I'll just have to wait.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I'm astounded by this app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Love this keyboard, my Samsung keyboard sucks
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Great app.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Best keyboard on the app store, unparalleled accuracy for the prediction
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"A wonderful keyboard.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I come from iOS and the predictions and word completions for their keyboards and their dictionary is second to none.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"SwiftKey however is rapidly approaching and is a wonderful transition.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Definitely worth the buy!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"No comment at this time
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"For a moment i cheated on you with Go Keyboard.. but came back crawling to you.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I love you pumpkin, you are the best
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"As soon as I upgraded from my old incredible this was the first app I reinstalled.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Best keyboard you can have no doubt.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"I like this keyboard, it really learns how I write.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"That is the most, second only to ""Settings"" with 44 MB.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"The next closes one is Lookout with 14 MB, just about half of what SwiftKey uses, both while idle.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"I know there should be a lot of RAM left on most modern phone, but that is not my point.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"I have other app I rarely use, but they still use RAM for no apparent reason.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"I uninstall them, I don't want to uninstall SwiftKey, but the native keyboard is catching up with SwiftKey and would have RAM usage on my phone.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Everything else about the SwiftKey keyboard is great.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"For most people how only istall a few Apps SwiftKey is a must install.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"I am not like most people, I try and use a lot of apps.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"Most people don't notice it, but if you do, it really starts to bug you!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"...feature then I may return but since GS3 JB update enabled Swype keyboard using that instead.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Other than that it's an awesome keyboard!!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"This is a really convenient app--
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"I was getting super frustrated with my Samsung S3s auto type.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"This saved me so much typing, it remembers your word patterns so that it can even guess whole sentences word by word!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"I love when apps know me, and spell how I spell =)
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Now that I have a tablet, I wish I didn't have to pay extra for that, too...
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best keyboard in the market
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Very nice keyboard....
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Does a better job than any other keyboard I've tried....
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Even ICS and JB stock keyboards do this.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I never buy apps and bc of how great the trial version was i bought the full version.
",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"A very good keyboard and the prediction is excellent.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"It is good but I feel like typing should be flawless on a keyboard.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Simply superb.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Easy to use and makes typing so much quicker.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Oh, and you can't do this on an iPhone!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"But I seriously can't wait till Swift key Flow comes out!!!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"Not perfect, but I miss it when it's not installed...
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I don't hate typing on my phone as much as I used to.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"This is my personal favorite keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"The prediction is amazing.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Simply the best keyboard.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Switched from slideit.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Totally worth it.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"And you can use different dictionaries without having to switch the whole time!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommended.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I love this keyboard I will never use another crappie android keyboard again!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"No issues whatsoever.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"If you come from iOs, you know the day and night different between the two stock keyboards.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Android keyboard is suck but I can assure u that this keyboard will make your life on Android phone a lot better.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Truly great keyboard.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The predictions are stunningly accurate.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"My favourite feature is that it can handle more than one language.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"No need to switch manually.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best keyboard i've used.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"It predicts what I want to write.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Plus it's really useful to write using with different languages at the same time!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"This app used to be great, it would accurately predict when I was typing all over the place.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"100x better than the default keyboard for Android
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I hated my keyboard when I went from s2 to s3 but after downloading I have a new love for my phone again. :-)
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"thanks a must download.!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"At first I regretted making the switch.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"The s3 keyboard is garbage.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"With this keyboard its beast, text just like I phone and super easy to use.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It makes you coherent when otherwise you wouldn't be.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"The best at predictions beating Android native because it adds and learns new words automatically rather than manual adding.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Predictions surprisingly accurate based on historic usage of words together.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth the money.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Lots of options.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Just gone from Galaxy SII to Note II and it helps to be able to adjust key height.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"By the way for the review saying you can't remove words that you don't use, you can by long pressing and clicking remove on the predictions
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Defiantly would recommend this keyboard to anyone that would like to be more effective typing on touchscreens.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Very small problems when compared to this amount of effort and time that this keyboard has saved me.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It is an excellent app, and it learns really quickly..
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"it looks good, and gives your keyboard a nice finish..
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"worth buying
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"I've been using this for over a year, and of all the apps I use, this is probably the most essential.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Its an awesome keyboard to replace the built in ones
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Finally I could text.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Love the keyboard!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Now I'm just waiting on FLOW!

lenfive,ratingfive,"Can't wait for Flow!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Love this app on my note 2
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I'm not a typer but this app makes me look like I've been doing it all my life.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Had the free version loaded for about a month.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"It only made my typing more efficient.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"They have stats in the app to illustrate the improvement - but it's not too hard to see on your own.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"But it does it's job freakishly well.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Well worth the keesh.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"it just works, I don't even have to press the space button and it still knows what I'm saying!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"The theme is awesome
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Awesome auto correct, fast to type on.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Reliable and easy to use.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Can't wait for flow
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Release swift key flow alreadyyyyyy!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"No where near as accurate as they fake it in the video.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"One of the first things they teach you about Android is to look at permissions for apps.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"This is true for both malicious apps and legitimate apps that could cause security concerns.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingone,"The trade off for this security concern is text prediction no better than any other keyboard.
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"Be smart and avoid this one.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I have had this keyboard in he past and have yet to find another quite like this one.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"It's well known that it's a poor business practice to make your existing customers suddenly pay more to use an existing product.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"Suddenly charging existing customers for use on tablets smacks of lousy business acumen.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I've been using this for a fair few months now and it's fantastic!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Highly recommend.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I can write whole texts pretty much by just typing one word!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"Doesn't happen in other keyboards on the market :-(
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"For the support team.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Very kind and accurate, I have really appreciate the quick answer.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"The keyword is awesome, makes me feel like I speak languages I don't ;)
",non-info
lensix,ratingthree,"Which is already became sms replacement....
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Truly changes the way my android device handles my typing styles on various formats.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Other than that, a superb app!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Money well spent!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The best taxting apps on the market I recommend this to everyone.
",non-info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"I haven't used this keyboard for that long but it feels like I have been missing out all this time when I was using the other third party keyboards.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Since using this app it haven't changed a phrase that I use to something completely different.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Keep up the good work because I'm happy that I purchased this app.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"I love how accurite it is when I type.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"I'm a rapid texter and this is so much better than the stock keyboard from Android.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfour,"I have the Galaxy Nexus, with the AOKP ROM.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Better than factory installed.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Finally a keyboard that suits me!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Thank you! Brilliant!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I highly recommend it this to anyone.

",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Hi Persians (Iranians) ;-)
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great keyboard.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Freekishly accurate!!
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"My friends couldn't believe that everything came out 100 percent accurate when typing like.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"Google voice input enters al words correctly but hardly inserts any fullstop or comma.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is the best keyboard I have found on here and I have had many!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Using the 'pumpkin' theme at the moment as it is the closest one to my theme:)
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"So worth the money!!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It's like it knows what I'm thinking.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"The corrections are even more accurate than the iPhone keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Love the 10 key too!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Freakishly accurate at times.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I'm really looking to the flow update to go with it.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Had my Android 3 years now and this is the first app I've purchased.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"This should illustrate how great it is.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Makes no sense.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Company could care less about adding real functionality.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingone,"Feature requests for real functionality sit and collect dust while fluff skinning type ones get done.
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"Thank God I got it for a dime.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"It almost seems like it reads your mind.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This keyboard does everything and can be modified to look and feel how you want!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"This must be the first app installed on every DROID world wide
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"I am sick of how paid users are being treated.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Yes you may have made my money, but rest assure I will never ever recommend this app to anyone else.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingone,"And to all other who is considering getting this app, if you like to be ignored then this is the right app for you.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I really like this keyboard app
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I've tried so many and always come back to this one.

lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is the only app I've ever bought and the only keyboard I use
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"After blasting a previous version of this app which had major usability glitches, I have to say that this is now my favourite keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Being in Montreal, I switch between French and English constantly.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Swiftkey runs both languages simultaneously so I don't actually have to switch...
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"it knows which language I'm typing in and corrects or suggests the appropriate word.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"What's amazing is how accurate the predictions are.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"In the near totality of cases, the suggested or corrected word is the right one.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"The keyboard does vibrate, it's in the settings in SwiftKey (haptic feedback) .

lenseven,ratingfive,"Also, I'm ready for more themes.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingthree,"Was great on my nexus s but on the Xperia u it causes quite a bit of lag on coming up and down to the point where the whole phone feels sluggish.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"That isn't to say that the dwiftkey keyboard is bad, if it weren't for the lag it would be great
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"What I like here is the intelligence and the prediction power, which, by the way, can be improved.
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfive,"Now the prediction is based just on recent writing, if I go back to continue a bit older texts with special terminology I realize that all the power of prediction is gone, have to learn it again from zero..

lensixteen,ratingthree,"PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"The keyboard itself is great but the word predictions are atrocious.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"Why can't it learn directly from all of my typing, instead of having to via gmail, twitter or Facebook - none of which I have.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Please improve the predictions.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"It's alright I guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"But keeps failing to download English language pack update so now I have no autocorrect :(
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"I would give it a 5 star as it's perfect but it's annoying that despite being set as my default keyboard I still have to switch to it every time my phone restarts.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"I like the speed it allows me to type but the predictions that automatically insert when I don't notice change my word completely.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"And the most annoying thing of all that hasn't been fixed yet by any update, is the app some how turns off my haptic feed back.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"There's a bug where the predictive keyboard doesn't always register. You have to come out of the message and go back into it.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingthree,"The word prediction is spot on, the different themes look great, but the inability to use swype is annoying, as is the inability to use ALT+backspace to delete an entire line of text.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"Because if a user inputs a VALID word, the program should NOT auto-replace it with anything else, no matter how much more relevant it thinks that is.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Only thing lacking is the ability for handwriting with note 2 spen.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"I'd like it more context sensitive (eg: email vs sms, my gf vs my boss,  etc), but not sure if android passes that info.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"IT FORCES CLOSE WHEN USING ON CHROME, quite randomly, but too often to be acceptable.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"But has an annoying habit of auto correcting correctly spelt shorter words into inappropriate longer ones.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of memory
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"As I'm typing the cursor jumps to the middle of a sentence.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It has some great features, but there is a noticeable lag with my GSM Galaxy Nexus.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingone,"the whole point of the Samsung Galaxy is the swiping, it differs from every other kind of phone, and this app does not support swiping this app sucks,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!!!!!!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"5 stars when i can disable prediction in favor of more screen real estate.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"Was working fine until it said that it is unable to load language packs, including English!
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"1. Landscape is always full screen (no option)
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"2. No option to toggle auto-space after punctuation and selecting predicted/corrected word.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"2. Prediction doesn't show up in a lot of cases where it should - should always pop up unless in a username or password dialog.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"4. Speech to text doesn't come up reliably - many times pops up and immediately disappears.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"5.  Sometimes sluggish to open / type.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"Why there is no Chinese language in this keyboard.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"And also pls have more theme color
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Would give 5 stars but it keeps defaulting back to the stock keyboard.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingthree,"I would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a SWYPE style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"Lately there has been issues where the auto correct won't work and sometimes I'll type but nothing pops up, not until I try like 100 times
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"1) SwiftKey should learn from sms, Gmail etc automatically without having to go through settings manually. Before I knew this it annoyed me SwiftKey wasn't learning from my sms.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"2) when you type a word that's not in the dictionary and SwiftKey changes it to something I don't want, when I backspace I should have my originally typed word as an option.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"I just wish I could download more themes
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"In the configuration screen I set it as my default keyboard but after a while it keeps shifting to another keyboard.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Wish we had a support forum about the product we download.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"Please add emoji there is alot of free keyboards have the emoji symbols :-$
",info
leneight,ratingone,"Phones keeps hanging and crashing after last update
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"very nice keyboard but only thing lacking is choice of themes.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"almost all themes are with closely spaced keys.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"you guys shud add more themes like sony keyboard style or iphone style or stock android jellybean look
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Loving this keyboard so far, would give it 5 stars except that there is no support for Chinese typing yet.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"Minor niggles are: Please make apostrophes, colons and semi-colons behave like commas and full stops. ie automatic changing of space position.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Apostrophes could be dealt with better too with respect to prompting.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"Only problem I ever had was that it often capitalizes words it shouldn't. Like the dutch word ""door"" or ""dank"".
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"Perhaps implement swipe that works as well as Google's implementation and I'll try it again?
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"My only gripe is that it doesn't have more black themed keyboard for us AMOLED screen users (to save power!).
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"The Neon theme is getting a little old...
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It crashes every time when I add tags into Tumblr app.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"I wish it was swype capable
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"Only if there were more options to customize the UI.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"Got no use for smileys, instead I'd like to bind that to open the second page of special characters.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"Doesn't learn some words despite multiple entries.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"And now it's failing to show the predictive word bar.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"Works great except several times everyday I have to set it as my default.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Got annoyed after they teased us with an upcoming swype like feature and haven't heard anything about it since...
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Well would be better if it were a bit more customizable where the user can define the words and shortcuts.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"Since I updated to 4.2, the keyboard has been way slower.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"Unable to install after second step.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"Seriously what's with them having access to everything we type???
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"Would love it if it had more symbols though :)
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"Not the first time the bloody thing outdates all language packs with no warning when I have no network access.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"The only thing it's missing is more character options!!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfour,"It's an amazing keyboard except that if you misspell a word and it underlines it, and you select the proper word it doesn't actually change it. It just puts the cursor at that location.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"This is a great app even if now there is the new android 4.2 but to get 5 stars it HAS to have SWIPE like in the new version of android!!!!!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I only wish there was an option to disable the instant space after a punctuation.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I constantly hit the space bar after inserting a period which adds a word that I didn't want there.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"On jellybean now on note 2. Really buggy now.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Very slow to backspace through words and randomly won't display autocorrect suggestions or correct anything.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"Have to close keyboard and reopen to get suggestions way too often.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"Has been brilliant but something has caused the language packs not to download!
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"But on my Thunderbolt multi touch has issues.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"It's a very good application but it support traditional Chinese language will be perfect.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"One thing though, it always corrects ""texting"" to ""testing"" is texting not a word or something?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"A few more themes would be nice.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"Only thing missing is a clipboard but other than that it fires on all cylinders
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"My only complaint is that every time I restart the phone, it goes back to the default factory Samsung keyboard.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"Can't turn off the auto inserted space after a period or question mark. All my messages now have extra spaces after them.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"Love this keyboard, but every time I turn the handset off and on it loses default settings.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Only one problem is that I don't always get the word select option in some apps such as Firefox.
",info
lenfiftyone,ratingthree,"It's the best keyboard I have used by far, and I love the themes (but maybe a couple more? Or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change ""love"" to ""live"" (or something similar).
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"Edit: Half the time, dragging for punctuation deletes the word I'm typing since JB update.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"Some of the layout designs annoy me and it takes a long-press to activate voice typing which is frustrating when in a hurry.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"Worked a couple times before crashing.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"Now can't get beyond choosing English language download due to 'network error', no matter how good my connection is.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"Trying to type a username and the autocorrect changes it.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"Good app but ever since my phone updated to jelly bean today, the keyboard has been a little laggy.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"And the hepatic feedback feels different than it did before. Even at 2ms I can feel it way more than I could before when it was at 7ms, which is inconvenient.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"And what's with not being able to put arrow keys on the tablet version?
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I'd really like to see a winter/Christmas theme like they havr for Halloween though.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"Also doesnt have a feature to minimize the keyboard. I could not access a certain app one time because of this.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingone,"so when I am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back. not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"I find myself constantly switching between LastPass & SwiftKey Keyboards. :-\
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"Although it kinda Sucks how I had to pay for multiple Downloads for each of my devices.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"i like everything about this app with 1 (very significant) exception.no swipe feature.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"i am super-dependent on using swipe to enter words, so without that, there's no real point in me having this app.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"It won't autocorrect my misspellings when set to inert a period with double space.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"when set to insert a prediction, will insert a random word whenever I use punctuation and then space.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"the only problem i have is the themes, needs more.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"The only issue I have is lack of themes.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Also, no Japanese support!? ...
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Which is lame. :/
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"After the last update and the (smart space) I lost all my respect to this keyboard.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I really didn't expect this app to be this good.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Just as it has done with this whole review.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"It absolutely rocks on the tablet.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"If you're a Galaxy S3 user, shut up and give them your money.
",non-info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"SwiftKey took one of the biggest negative things about my phone's overall usability and made it one of its best features.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"Obviously, you like anecdotal evidence if you're reading reviews, so here are the results of a typing test I just did comparing the native Samsung keyboard to iOS and SwiftKey.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"It's well worth your money.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"Complete trash compared to the PERFECT KEYBOARD.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"In fact this happened while typing this review.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"This ap helps..
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Great work for language input.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"I have only 1 complaint.
",non-info
leneight,ratingtwo,"With that, this would be a 5 star app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingone,"what a scammy way to do things.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"I want my refund...
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's amazing how accurate the auto correct is and how it adapts to your typing style.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"Other keyboards work fine with it.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I really can't believe I've lived for years without thus keyboard app.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The left swipe erase makes it great.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Can't live without it
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Must have app for all android users......
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"SwiftKey is probably going to be the first and only app I will ever buy for my phone.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"It just learns it by itself!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Maybe fix?
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Ended up shelling out for it when trial expired.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"The set up, feel, look and overall flow is incredible.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Learns how I type and what I would most likely say.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"I am so used to this new keyboard that I don't want to go back.
",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"The keyboard is quite customizable and has a lot of options that makes it a product you can't miss on your Android device.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"Also any way to make the keyboard scroll down while trying to view text in horizontal mode?
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"iPhone's can.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Otherwise, excellent!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"I've tried many downloaded keyboards and this one is by far the best. Awesome app.!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Amazing keyboard.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I am SO glad I bought this.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Running this on GB 2.36, CM9,  and CM10.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"I've used so many keyboards including Swype Beta but this app beats them all in overall speed and accuracy.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"While I do like swiping, but it's only fast for small words.
",non-info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"So when I tried SwiftKey I was surprised how it almost types itself,  thus,  saving a lot of time. Been using this for over a month - typing on touchscreen is actually enjoyable now. LOL!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Way better than the crappy android ones.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"I don't use Swype now.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"Predictions are really very good.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingthree,"Makes this keyboard useless.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"App is completely unusable.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Best keyboard ever!
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"I love the keyboard but not all the problems it has caused!
",non-info
leneight,ratingone,"I bought this keyboard for my fat fingers.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"A must buy app.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It's got awesome prediction capabilities and really great keyboard interface.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Probably its gingerbread's fault
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"I'm a fast typer.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Pops up words and phrases I use all the time.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"But this keyboard is awesome!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Better than I hoped.
",non-info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"The Samsung stock keyboard on my Galaxy siii is so lame in comparison, it makes me think Samsung is getting a kickback from Swiftkey and Google;)
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"This app is really amazing how it can improve your typing.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I it is also a Bonus that you can customize the keyboard in awesomeness!!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Well I have found my new keyboard i have tried many and this seems to be the best...!
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"This is my favorite keyboard again..
",non-info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"it's so bad ..
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"It almost seems as if it's reading your mind.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Talk about saving a lot of valuable time.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"I don't know how I survived without this app.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Definitely a buy.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I have been using SwiftKey for the past 1 year on the S2 and Note 1 and no problems at all.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth every penny!!!!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I think the above comment says it all.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I've even used Swype and this is still my favorite. :)
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"And is way better then stock keyboard...
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Best keyboard in the android market.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Smooth typing and soooo smart!
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Thanks SwiftKey!
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Makes typing easier, effortless and consume less time.  B-)
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"The video says it all.

",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Awesome stuff
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Excellent keyboard experience!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Love this app more everyday
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Fantastic work!
",non-info

",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Best key board I have ever tried!!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"And I have tried alot of um
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"This is the best. Period.
",non-info
leneight,ratingtwo,"Smooth as butter when is at its best ..
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"Very overrated keyboard in general in my opinion.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I was without this for a day or so and was lost...
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Great, one of the best keyboard for Android.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Title basically says it all.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It would definitely be the first thing to install.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"Makes typing ridiculously fast and highly customizable.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"For the keyboard on the next update?
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It is elegant and works well but I have just bought SlideIT and works better for me
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Amazingly accurate, nimble, impossible to go back to any other keyboard after you get used to this one.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Any I've tried several.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"I got the free trial and after using it for just a few hours I bought the full version.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"I don't find the keyboard layout all that unique (and the number pad takes some getting used to), but the predictive text is second to none.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"It makes all of my messages and email so much quicker and I don't think I could go back now!
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"It's pretty decent straight from the start but the more you use it, the more it learns from you and within a few days I'm typing better than I ever have from a touchscreen device
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Should be on every android device.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I highly recommend it.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Best app I have bought!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingone,"Who thought this was a great idea to force onto people?
",non-info
lensix,ratingone,"What's a wrong swiftkey people.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Great settings!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"Useless on the Galaxy S3
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I am too use to sliding my finger to type now.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfour,"Perfect keyboard minus a couple things.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"I love it better than the one came with the phone
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Predicts text unbelievably well.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Definitely recommend the download.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"This does save you from many keystrokes.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"However,  the keyboard system that comes with touchwiz sucks pretty bad!!!
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"And when you type a wrong word it fixes to the one that you were looking for!!!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Swift key is awesome.
",non-info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"I'm a fast typist and I miss the mark on most android keyboards but Swift key picks up what I'm typing flawlessly I wouldn't recommend any other keyboard.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"It would let me sent nonsense words I've mistyped, something the iphone auto corrected.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"Swift key not only auto corrects but it learns from your typing style.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"I love this keyboard its the best 4 dollars I have ever spent.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Very useful and easy to use.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"You can also set it for spell checker but it doesn't automatically insert what IT thinks you mean.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingone,"Love this app but for the moment it's too much work.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I don't think so.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Otherwise an excellent keyboard with excellent predictive text and excellent spell check.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Not sure what is causing it but fix that and you will have pure keyboard perfection!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Great keyboard, very accurate!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"Just try and go back to a default keyboard after using this trial for a month.
",non-info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"got this a while back in the sale for 25p but had then got a iphone , but changed back to android recently , so installed again on my htc desire .
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"i have allowed the app access to Facebook and twitter and also my sms messages to learn my style of writing .
",non-info
lenfive,ratingthree,"It's a normal keyboard.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"would be excellent after that.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"I have used this app for about one year and it is by far the best keyboard on any smart phone.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"It seriously makes typing sooo much faster and easier.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"It learns from what I type and predicts crazy accurate stuff!
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I don't like something change it.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Like eveything else on this phone :)
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I love it makes my sms much better for things you get lazy about.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Way better than the terrible Samsung Galaxy S3 keyboard.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"It's way faster and a million times more accurate.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Do yourself a favor and download this app.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"The factory keyboard on my galaxy s3 is terrible.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"This app is awesomeness but not without problems.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Learns as you type and makes perfect corrections.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"The best keyboard for fast typers.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I honestly think this is the best keyboard on android.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingthree,"But not anymore...
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"Decent keyboard but not enough to warrant a purchase over the stock.
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"If this app and thumb keyboard could somehow have a baby app, then that would be the best keyboard ever.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Makes the predictions amd corrections with great ease and accuracy!
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Overall very good.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"That would make it perfect.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I can't believe I was using the standard s3 keyboard for so long!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"This thing is simply the best touch screen keyboard I've ever used!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"I wish I would have downloaded it earlier!
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"That said, SwiftKey is an extremely competent app that gets a deserved 5* from me and a huge well done and thanks to the dev team!
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"Going back to the android default made my texting while driving made it 10 times more dangerous than it already is.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Excellent and very useful!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingthree,"I do I need to buy it again for my tablet?
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"Between this and swype its even bcuz they both work great and do what their supposed to do.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's just great, the looks of keyboards, how it knows what I'm about to type!
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Predictions are changing to your style and tailored to YOU.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfour,"Overall, great keyboard.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"I live this keyboard.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I have use so many android keyboards and non of them even come close to this one!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"Other than that,  this is a brilliant app:)
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"If that could be fixed i would rate this 5 stars
",non-info
lentwenty,ratingone,"It sucks too that they offer to get the tablet version instead, but of course, you have to pay again...
",non-info
leneight,ratingfour,"I can't type without this swift :-o
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"This is the BEST keyboard out there.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingone,"Please fix it.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I would suggest it to anyone.
",non-info
leneight,ratingthree,"I use apostrophes and dot com a lot.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Ridiculous that assessment, bit cheaper, shot, duck, and see are all changed.
",non-info
lenten,ratingtwo,"It becomes more of a nuisance instead of a features.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"I've been using it for months and I can't imagine going back to anything else.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfour,"Would be 5 star if it was less than a pound
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"Man what a great upgrade to the factory keyboard on the phone.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"I am a want a be texter.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I used the trial version of SwiftKey 3 for a month and loved it.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Ive been using it for 1 full month and now im going to buy it!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"Have reinstalled several times.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"You new to get this lol wow
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Buy it and never look back.
",non-info
lenten,ratingone,"No reply to my request to have the difference refunded.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"Soo much better than the Android and Samsung keyboard on my phone.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"SwiftKey can finish your words, make predictions and know what you're typing even without hitting the scape bar.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Great Job swift key team kudos to you.!!!
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"Truly does what the ad says it do.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Easily the best keyboard app.
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I can type on this just as I could type on my blackberry.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"Infinitely better than Android's out-of-the-box keyboards.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Very impressive indeed.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfour,"Hopefully it will come in the future.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Very fast and easy.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"It's nice and perfect, but still has 2 problem to choose;
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfour,"If it updated, probably would be the best keyboard for Android.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfour,"Now 4 star.
",non-info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"Hard to go back to the default keyboard after using this, and finally made me appreciate touch screen typing.
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"It's amazing and it will change your life if you text a lot or use twitter frequently.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"Without this I can't text for the life of me.
",non-info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"At first I was skeptical even though I'd seen this app on the market for quite some, but I was hooked once I used the trial.
",non-info
lenten,ratingfive,"I have been using it for a long time now....
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"It's awesome works the best on T-mobile GS2 I can't use any other keyboard now..

lenthirteen,ratingfour,"I was so frustrated with the keyboard options that came with my phone.
",non-info

lenthree,ratingfive,"It's maddening.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"I buy this app immediately
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"I tried the trial and this was simply the best keyboard I've ever used.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"In ICS, though, it's very responsive and fast.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I like the way it suggests words when you backspace to change a word.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"I've tried everything out there and nothing comes close in prediction and ease of use.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"I thought it was an ics problem but no other keyboard is lagging like this.

leneleven,ratingfive,"This is so much easier to use than the original keyboard.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Just love it
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"I'm really looking forward to seeing its potential against other swiping keyboards.

leneight,ratingfive,"Adaptxt and multiling outperform swiftkey in this respect.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"It is awesome!!!
",non-info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"I don't know if the problem will ever occur again, but for now it has been fixed.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Predictions is Swiftkeys advantage.

lennine,ratingfive,"I don't know how I survived without it.
",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"I can type so quickly and poorly and yet it will correct every word in a paragraph correctly without me having to backspace even once.

",non-info
lentwentyfive,ratingtwo,"3 weeks without even a response from SwiftKey suggests they may be more interested in their Flow version than making sure the current one works though.

leneight,ratingone,"so I'm not liking it so far.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfive,"Makes messaging so much easier
",non-info

",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I wish I would've downloaded sooner.

lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"The Swype might seem faster than normal, but text predictions on this App are always better, so I can actually text faster because of it, 2nd to none.
",non-info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"The android keyboard is nice, however the SwiftKey keyboard is even better!
",non-info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"With it's features, I have gotten used to SwiftKey in a day.

",non-info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"To be fair, i've only been using swiftkey for a few days, but it's not for me.
",non-info

",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It's a good app that does exactly what it says, but it has its downfalls.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"But like I said, I've only been using it for a few days.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"I'll keep using it for a few more and see if it grows on me.

",non-info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"What I can say as an Android touch screen user is that this the best piece of mobile software that I have ever downloaded.

",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"I mean they all suck, right?
",non-info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"Swiftkey lets me throw my fingers in the key's general direction, and whether or not I hit the right ones it almost always seems to know what I'm looking for.

lentwelve,ratingfive,"This however is a vast improvement and I love it so much.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"I love how you can have different.
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"Themes for the keyboard.

",non-info
lensix,ratingthree,"Worked great with that and ics.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"Still waiting for a fix before switching back to stock or using smart keyboard, etc.

",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"The absolutely best testing app I've ever seen.
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Used to think swipe typing was the fastest but the prediction on this keyboard is a revelation.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"Makes one hand or two hand typing really fast.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"Worth the price.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Even Google's new keyboard in 4.2 with real time prediction doesn't match this.

lenfive,ratingfive,"This is a wonderful keyboard.
",non-info

",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"Never thought I would like a keyboard better than swype but now I do.
",non-info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"I think it's very smart that you guys decided to make it as an update for those who have already purchased instead of making us buy it again.

lenthirteen,ratingfive,"On another note I didn't think this keyboard could get any better!
",non-info
lenfour,ratingfive,"It's just... Perfect
",non-info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"Been on SwiftKey for over a year now, it is responsive and the prediction engine is excellent.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"I especially love the num pad, much more intuitive than a row of numbers.
",non-info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"I even tried the latest stock Android 4.2 keyboard (which has swipe like feature) and am very sure I can type faster on SwiftKey.
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"Much better that the stock keyboard.

",non-info
lennine,ratingthree,"Is this a problem with JB, the S3 or SwiftKey?
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"After using this keyboard now for several months I have had no problems with it.
",non-info
lennine,ratingfive,"The themes are great and the usability is great.
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"The GB keyboard is awful and so is the ICS keyboard.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"This is a must have tool and it really makes your device much more usable.
",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"But apart from that it's great.
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"It appears to be a minor glitch and not an actual function of the keyboard itself.

leneleven,ratingthree,"In lieu of these issues being adjusted, I will give 5 stars.
",non-info
lentwo,ratingfive,"Briliant App.

",non-info
lenseven,ratingfive,"The default keyboard on my device sucks.

lenfour,ratingtwo,"Nexus One on Gingerbread
",non-info
lenfour,ratingone,"Makes it completely useless
",non-info
lensix,ratingfive,"only for swiftkey to break it.
",non-info
lenthree,ratingfive,"a shame, really.
",non-info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"since it is really the one thing that sets them apart from the rest of the other keyboard apps out there.
