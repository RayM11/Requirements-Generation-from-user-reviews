",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"so sick and tired of getting network error messages when at the same time, facebook web works fine!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"i always have to close the app from my multi-tasking so that the next time i open it, it will hopefully load my newsfeed.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"pictures and new stories load pretty slowly.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"my biggest pet peeve is that i can't ""like""
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"things 95% of the time, or it takes five or six taps to register the ""like.""
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"notifications frequently take me to something irrelevant.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"this is constantly having problems loading comments.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"i can almost never get them to show on pictures, status updates or anything else.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"has anyone else been having issues with constant force close?
",info
lensix,ratingone,"can't post since last update.
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"also, they need to make it so that you can hide posts from certain people like the website does.
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"the app is good & all, but some images in my news feed can only be previewed instead of opened.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"occasionally, the app says that the image can't be opened & please try again later.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"move to sd please
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"news feed shows no pics...
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"the only thing about the newer app i hate is the ""like"" and ""comment"" feature is broken.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"i have installed and  uninstalled this several time to get an up to date time line....
",info
lenten,ratingone,"slow, rarely loads anything - pages, photos, comments - nothing, constantly crashes.
",info
lentwentysix,ratingone,"i can't change my covert photo from my phone,  searching for anything is awful, i have to type , then delete, then retype, then it works.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"loading pics and comments take much longer, i.don't like it.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"serious bug dealing with notifications.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"opening app from a notification after its been running in the background for a while results in endless wait loop.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"never shuts down in the background and has no exit button.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"reinstalled to get the share link back bit the churning following a notification is still awful.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"still has issues with check-ins. :|
",info
lentwentythree,ratingthree,"after the latest update, i have not been able to post status updates on the first try, even with strong 4g data or wifi.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"generally speaking, the app seems much slower than previous versions.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"i see ""unable to establish a secure connection"" errors often.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingthree,"also it refreshes while i'm trying to read updates in my news feed and seems me to top of news feed page so i have to scroll and search for what i was reading.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"facebook crashes at least three times a day on my galaxy s2.
",info

",info
lensix,ratingthree,"scrolling lag from time to time.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"slow loading after last update...
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"rarely refreshes news feed on the first try.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"only shows up to 98 likes on a photo
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"i wish we could save pics from this app
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"does everything you would expect, still needs some work on the approvals for privacy confirmation process.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"but the major issue i have is some background task is grinding my phone to a halt.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i cant delete comments anymore ever since i updated it ..
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"pointless to even have on my phone anymore can't even use it like i should be able to..

",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"after updating my system shuts down, i get errors and i can't post anything.
",info
leneight,ratingone,"will not refresh at all on my droid

lentwenty,ratingone,"far too slow never loads , cant see anything , 'crap' any time i refresh it goes straight onto my actual internet !!!
",info
lensix,ratingone,"keeps crashing, forcing it to close.
",info
lenfive,ratingone,"also you carnt view pictures
",info
lensixty,ratingone,"yeah so this app ain't bad i use it more than the browser but that's gonna change, i was wondering why my phone memory was all gone so i decided to uninstall the updates now i got a load more memory, so until you can save this app to the memory card then i'm not using it.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"won't even let me log in!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingtwo,"for some reason i cannot update my facebook status, leave comments, like things or perform any action on the mobile device that actually works.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"keeps losing conection, therefore uninstalling updates
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"on my nexus seven tablet, nothing loads.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"i simply get a network error message.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"dear facebook,  please stop prompting me to add friends every friggin time i open your app.
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"it worked perfectly fine for me until yesturday when i was on my laptop and changed my password, it logged me off my phone so i logged in with the new password and it kept saying error.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"can't remove comments anymore.

lennine,ratingtwo,"been having issues with newsfeed refresh prior to that.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"now it tells me i have a single sign-on error, which even the great google search has not given me any clues on how to fix.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"it will sign in, but won't sync anything and won't post anything so it's basically useless for my purposes.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"so u have to ask me if i want to use my contacts to find friends multiple times a day.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"can't type two words without the thing crashing...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"the only complaint i have is that it has problems loading pics.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"it's slow to load (probably because it's searching my 'phone for stuff) .
",info

lenfive,ratingtwo,"it won't load pictures
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfour,"the bad: when i type more than a few words in a post or comment, the app freezes, more often than not. i lose everything i typed and have to start again.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"also: there's no way to upload a photo directly to one person's wall.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfour,"another neat option, if the developer wanted to make this really awesome, is an option to pre-cache recent posts by friends and in groups, for offline (aka subway) viewing.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfour,"and dare i dream of posting comments offline, that post as soon as i get reception again?
",info
lennineteen,ratingone,"ever since it upgraded, it shuts down and locks me out with a black screen for a good 10 mins.

",non-info
lensix,ratingtwo,"getting very aggravated after latest update.
",non-info
leneight,ratingfive,"iphone app is beastin this out the box!!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"since the updates, facebook for android has become, in my opinion, a much better app.
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"it's easy to use, and you can now effectively see an 'offline news feed'!
",non-info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"with simple-to-use features such as a 'pull down and release' mechanism to refresh the page, a swipe-out chat bar on the right and a swipe-out menu on the left, user friendliness is great!
",non-info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"the app is quick to run, and doesn't consume battery life when running either!
",non-info
leneleven,ratingfive,"overall, a superbly updated app from the previous versions, very happy!

lensix,ratingfour,"much better now, the latest update.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"also feels clunky to use.
",non-info
lenten,ratingtwo,"meaning android task manager needs to step in to kill.
",non-info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"sent a report several times in the past, don't see this being fixed.

lennine,ratingone,"it doesn't matter if i have 3g, 4g or wifi!
",non-info
lenfive,ratingfour,"feel great to have it!
",non-info
lensixteen,ratingone,"instead of faffing around adding things that aren't needed sort all the other issues out.

",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"very very bad user experience.
",non-info
lenfive,ratingone,"dead useless since latest update.
