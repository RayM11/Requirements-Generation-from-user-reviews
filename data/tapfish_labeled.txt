",info

",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"would someone like to explain why the frog challenge just ended a day early?
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"wish there were faster growing fish and that there were minigames to play to kill time
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"the only thing i wish is that if you can turn coins into fish bucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"like 10,000 coins could get you 2 fish bucks and 20,000 coins could get you 5 or 6.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"love this game but is so hard 2 earn fish bucks
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"but maybe have the option of buying fish bucks with the coins, something to get more and faster.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"didn't get my $22 fish bucks for downloading ship wrecked!!
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"this game can be very fun but it takes up so i much of your time taking care of the fish!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"if you don't feed them for a day all the fish die, it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"ripped off    75 bucks...
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"beware of this app,   when  a fish burp's  good bye to your fish bucks.

",info
lenseven,ratingone,"and refuse to replace missing buck's.......  :(  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :'( :'(  :'( :'( :'( :'( :'(

",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"if only it was easier to get fish bucks....
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"great game, just wish it didn't take so long to breed the fish! 3 days is a bit much.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"love it think its cool only complaint is i don't get the free fish bucks from the earn free fish bicks part
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"poor would not connect to the internet: (
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"its plays well but items ony last so long
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love the game i just wish it didn't take so long to get money
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love this game but i do wish that you could get fish buck way easier
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"love the game,  but it needs to have more fish you can buy with coins and less that you have to use the fishbucks for.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"to complete the game will cost u more than $200.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingtwo,"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"the only doubt is u can't get fishbucks 4 fishcash or whatever it is.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"its just i ain't willing to spend money for fish money
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"great ggame but takes too much internet
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"only thing i would change are the notifications.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"would rate it a 5 star but for some odd reason i can't breed any of my mystery fish so it's like if i bought them for nothing!:(
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"also lower the fish prizes a bit please and it will definitely be a 5 star game for me!!!:)
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"pass time favorite ,only dwn side is can't get fish bucks
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"great game can't stop playing, just wish breeding didn't take so long
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingthree,"this app does events all the time that make you accidentally use ""fish bucks"" which are almost impossible to earn and all the coolest stuff you have yo pay for with.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"never got my 100 dollar worth fishbucks
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i went to open my game an it says new bee event but nothin is there so u went to see if it needed updated an its up to date.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"plus i lost 20 fish bucks during the frog event & i'm not sure how it happened.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"takes way too long to breed fish though.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"and it is irritating that you don't stay in the shop when buying multiple fish.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"clicked on  bubble and accidentally lossed all fishbucks.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"would like to get the fb back.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingone,"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"also, alot of the free buck opportunities, do.not give you.the bucks and the fish prices have become outrageous :(
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"i would say the only thing i dont like about it is that its hard to earn fish bucks,and alot of fish you have to buy with the fish bucks....
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"so i would rate this app as perfect if you were able to get free fish bucks and or earn them easier...
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"and twice since the update all of my fish bucks have disappeared.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"i want my 20 fish bucks back
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"love this gane but would be great if the fish grew faster
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"wish there was a better to get fish bucks
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"its fun and is like having real fish could do with some different plants and decorations to be added on though.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"needs more ""free cash & coins"", but over all very cool game.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"i like the app but it wont let me buy fish so there is point keeping the app.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"would like more coin fish less $ fish and the tasks given to be for coin fish not $ fish
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"the fish that i'm breeding for the current event are disappearing when i move them into the tank.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"i would really like if i could move to another device it seems to be taking a lot of space!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"just wish you could earn fish bucks faster lol
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"great only thing that sucks is fish buck free offers. when ya try putting in numbers it kicks you out of the offers.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"easier way to get bucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"force closes alot but still love it.....
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"great time waster but to many fish for fish bucks i mean i have no money for fish bucks there needs to be less fish for fish bucks.
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"pretty easy to use and hamless unless you get greedy to have mmore coins or money.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"good game but need ways to earn more fishbucks
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingtwo,"i do like this game but i want to be able to earn fish bucks.because all the fish i like are are fish bucks for example phrina is 20 fish bucks ani only have 2.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"love this wish there want so many things to buy with bucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"love this game wish there was better ways to earn fish bucks though
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"great game but would be better if didn't force close so much
",info
lenthirtyeight,ratingfive,"the game is great the only problem is that my memory on my phone fills up to fast and the weather makes it lage a little but been a loyal fan and player for a year or so.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"drains battery on galaxy s2 epic 4g.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"sold fish bred during breeding even but game cheated me out of 6k+ coins.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"wish you could earn/find more fishbucks.....
",info
lenthirty,ratingtwo,"but not anymore can't breed the fish that i want too buy fish to breed and won't let me do it what is the point of this game...
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"cons - sometimes gliches -waaaaay too hard to get fish bucks
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"love the game feel that there needs to be more breedable fish and more ways to earn fish bucks
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"would like to see more scale.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"please fix it keeps sayin unable to conecte when i go to by fish but its a 5 star i love this game
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"good game but it just wants you to spend money :/

",info
leneight,ratingfive,"tack to long to load but good game
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"fish bucks too expensive
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"its fun, but fishbucks and coins are way too hard to get.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"you also should be able to do more things with your fish.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfour,"bee playing this game since two years ago wheni first started with my iphone ; tthe only complain is i cant carry forward all my points and levels after i switched to note 2!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"since last update i do not have some fish.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"getting free fish bucks is getting harder & harder & has not been updated in a mo. customer service is great and this fish game is way better then others.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"there is another glitch w/ feeding friends  takes up alot of space i have to uninstall & re install & restore alot!
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"definitely need more coin fish...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"is there anyway to get your game back if you switch phones??
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"also it freezes a lot
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"wish you could get more coins, bucks, and spins faster.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"a moderately entertaining game but still requiring real money for fake fishbucks to do much of anything.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"i wish all the good fish wasn't so high
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"great but cost too much fish bucks to play
",info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"the cost to play is too high and the software is buggy.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"cost of fish bucks is unreasonable as well.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"fun game, i love the variety of fish and decorations but it's so easy for your fish to die!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"i enjoy playing tap fish except for how hard it is to get fish bucks.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"just would like to get more bucks for doing things
",info
lenfortysix,ratingfour,"i like  it but they dont give enough money or coinsand if u dont login everyday your fish die, i have a job soi cant play games everyday so they should have babysitter fish to buy for like 20 coins who freeze tank for your vacation needs
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but some of the items an fish cost to much real money.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"a little cluttered and slow..
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"only wish there was a way to retrieve deleted tanks and transfer tanks from one phone to another.
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"its a little slow starting out.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"coins are super tight but the games pretty fun
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"need more ways to get fish bucks!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
",info
lenthirty,ratingthree,"update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"i love it just want more bucks rewards
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"slow but fun
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i used to have fishlive but it crashed on me all the time.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"why is tapfish disabled
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"forse closes allot when using certain feat.
",info
lenfour,ratingone,"updates killed my fish.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"deffenetly 4 stars only 4 because a little hard when ur not able to play for a while
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"i liked the game,but i needed to update my phone and application did not open,sad,had to uninstall,there were no instructions how to trouble shoot.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"great game but too slow
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"only problem is getting fish bucks to buy everything
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"love the game but sometime freezes
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"why can't we exchange coins in for fish bucks?
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"would have gotten 5 stars if i could of kept the game when i changed phones.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"becomes addicting and sometimes it had to froce close
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"this game is really fun i like it exept everything cost too much
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"i just wish it would quit shutting dowm for no reason.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"if u guys can fix that and stop wantimg so many fishbucks for things
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"very fun good way to pass time could fix lag though
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"it keeps glitching, and most times it tries to force close.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"we both love it i just wish u could make more money faster
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"jus wish it was easier to earn bucks.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"game is ok but there should be a way to get fish bucks like so many coins = one fish buck or something
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"it loads and updates sooo slow!
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"won't even let me download it but rated it any way:-)
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfive,"love this game only thing i'm mad about is i got a new phone and lost all my fish and could not get anything back :-(
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"this game is actually really fun, i wish you could get fish bucks easier though.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"some easier way of earing bucks would be better as there are challenges that you can't meet without them.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"with the recent android update, tapfish has gotten soooo slow!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i wish there were more challanges at a time.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"and not so many requiring fish bucks to buy things.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"just doesn't make sense to pay for fake money!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"also, there are too few options for those of us who can't/won't spend tons of money on fish bucks.
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"aren't you making enough money through ads?
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"do you really want to continue trying to bore us into buying fish bucks?
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"im not a fan of how the majority of fish and ornaments require ""fish bucks""
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"it kills time but there needs to be a way to ""pause""
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingone,"i downloaded shipwrecked and its been 2 days since i downloaded it and no free fish bucks are appearing in my fish bucks spot that's 22 fish bucks you owe me give them in 2days or i uninstall
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"accidently uninstalled reinstalled and restarted my sis went on and added me and it came up with my old 1 and all the fish dead but otherwise its great
",info
leneight,ratingtwo,"game should save itself to my play account.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"only wish you could change coins for bucks....
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"i updated tapfish because my phone said i had to, and the game had totally changed..
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble..
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"like the game, but i wish you could earn more fish bucks faster.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"great game but hard to get fishbucks which u need to get stuff in game
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"takes a lot of time to level up and speed ups cost bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i love playing this game i just wished i could gain levels much faster amiga...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"love the game just take to long to generate cash and bucks
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"way too slow for my phone.
",info
leneighteen,ratingone,"the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"only one thing to make it better, a sign in.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"now ive lot all my prizes  that's again tap fish, you're getting deleted finally
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
",info
lenthree,ratingone,"ripped off 75 bucks...
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingtwo,"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"it takes a while to load at first but its worth it!
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"it's fun but there isn't much to do after you clean the tank, feed and love the fish.
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"the bucks are impossible to earn, not enough instructions and to much waiting around for breeding to happen.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"pretty cool but everything is expensive
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
",info
lenfiftytwo,ratingfive,"i just wanna say that i love tapfish i just have one suggestion can u guys plz come up with some kind of password so that when friends who dont know what their doing grab ur phone and start messing with stuff dont sell all ur fish and mess up ur tanks.
",info
lenfortynine,ratingthree,"i think there should be a way to level up faster because it takes forever trying to level up, and maybe there should also be a breedable catagory for lazy people (such as i) that way we dont have to spwnd a half hour trying to find breedable fish
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"really good game only bad thing is tht most of the tsks u have to have fish bucks apart from that it is good
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"do more batfish
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"can't breed new fish often cause i can't get more than 2 tanks to bread, then it takes on average 3 days to breed one fish lol.
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfour,"however i wish a lot of the fish did not cost as much fish bucks as they do. its hard 2 earn enough of them in order 2 complete the tasks & it's expensive 2 buy them.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"plus it is hard to get fish bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"love this game but i agree there should be a way to level up faster
",info
lentwelve,ratingtwo,"could be a good game but is very slow & demanding of time
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"cute game but have to play it every day or fish will die of starvation
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"just wish it didn't take as long as it does to breed fish.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"i don't realy like the pictures and how it's so flat and boring, but i like the huge the selection of fish.
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfive,"the game is pretty fun jusr wish that the fish bucks were easier to get and everything was cheaper but overall p0retty fun i would recomend it also wish the fish didn't die so fast
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"fun game but super hard to earn fishbucks
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"enjoyable game,,,slow to start though.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks w/o having to buy them or download so many other apps.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"love the game but not 5 stars because the fish die way to fast
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"love this game but i wish you could get more fish bucks for free.
",info
leneighteen,ratingtwo,"boring and stupid because you need lots of money to buy things and they barely give u any
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"it's fun just long and alot of things you need fish bucks for but you barely get them for free
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"for 2 days and now it won't open any more
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"i wish i never updated my tap fish game i used to be able to buy puffer fish that would bring in the $$ but not any more.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks to get all of the crazy fishies!
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"only complaint it takes a few seconds to load.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"i love to play, but you need to spend lots of money to get fish to breed.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"needs more fish and new fish.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"could go a bit faster though
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"you can't do much without fish bucks and they cost $.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"game shuts down alot but other than that its great.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"stupid game give my more fish bucks
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"hard to obtain fish bucks.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"great game, but needs more fish for higher levels.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"i'm level 54 and there is nothing for several more levels.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"like alot, love fish, dont like 2 spend real money or have 2 download stuff u dont want just 2 get more bucks or coins.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"needs fake money 2 spend.
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"takes to long to level up and most quests take $ to complete!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"it doesn't give u hardly any coins for tending to ur fish!
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"however, it takes way too long to earn bucks.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"the challenges are fun at first but then it gets old.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"it constantly asks to buy more bucks.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"there should be an option to exchange coins for bucks.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"4/5 hard go get fish bucks but fun
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"there should be an easier way to get bucks. how 'bout every 500 coins you get you get one?
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"that way people can revive their fish without having to pay as often.
",info
lenforty,ratingfour,"i got a new phone and    now i cannot get back into the game that i have   spent so much money on i have been well over $1000.00 and it's a shame to lose everything that i just built up.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"i paid money to remove ads and i still got them
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but should have a way of buying fish bucks using your coins.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"wish the tutorial was a little slower.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"very good game, some lagging but that might just be my phone.
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"a little cluttered and slow.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"also alot of focus on fish bucks, which are hard to get without buying them.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"i wish there was more way to earn fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingone,"this last update stole millions of coins from my tank not to mention all the bs with the frog event.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"the only downfall is hard to get fish bucks without buying them.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"maybe trading coins for bucks or awarding more bucks when leveling up.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"would rate higher but to obtain breeder fish and other things you need to pay2play and i just can't offord it.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"dislike bubble tips and smiley faces on feed fish.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"it is very fun but make it a little more interactive with the fish
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i wish they could put in a permanet mini game to get fish bucks,coins,fish or decorations ethre
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"its a cool game but its stupid you can progress if u don't have bucks wilhich u need credit card for
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"it'll glitch everytime i go to play store then exit it and click the game itself on the phone it just goes right back to play store
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfive,"not giving all fishbucks when you download games also when foggy event was over did not receive breedable frog did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable froggy
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfour,"it does take an awfully long time to level up,  and it's unfortunate that so many basic things can only be bought with ""fish bucks"" which are very difficult to earn many of without paying money.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"and many quests require you to buy these things.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"i just wish you could advance up quicker yeah you can speed up your fish eggs to hatch.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingtwo,"it won't let me connect to the server. i report it every time but it is always the same thing.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"won't let me participate in the easter event.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"every time i catch the fish, it says ""image not found""
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"i love it (but why will they make the decoration's and every thing so much you can just get a fish with that money and fish buck's
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfive,"i 'v played this app before it crashs alot but i'm giving it a second chance if it did not crash i would have this app forevef
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"its fun except every thing needs fishbucks
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"love this game but very disappointed with the adds that pop up!
",info
lensix,ratingone,"you should monitor what's advertised.
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"hate waiting but great
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"takes a while to load but it already filled the last two hours of fun
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"it would be better if the game will allow me and my phone not to be on the internet all the time and still be this fun & cool!
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"good but the good fish cost fish bucks which you have to buy with real money and the fish are way to expensive.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"it also take way to long to level up.
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"can't breed the fish i want.
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"fish bucks are too much!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"thank you tap fish makers but please have more games to earn fish bucks !
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"wish it didn't take so long to breed special event fish.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"after the update the bubble icon is taking a lot of time this game is entertaining but it must be fast so to be fast please remove bubble icon
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"i also love the breeding just wish it didnt take  do long to breed!
",info
lentwentysix,ratingfour,"the only thing i don't like is that if you miss the deadline on an event cuz of work or anything there is no extension.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"changed phones and lost everything which stinks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"only wish fish bucks were easier to come by
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"there needs to be a way to transfer my game to another phone.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"spenf a lot if time and money on this then got a new phone and am having to start over!
",info
lenforty,ratingone,"ive switched phones, downloaded tap fish and i have to start all over again i believe i had pleanty more fish than the 2 i have now and my fish bucks are gone how do i get my fish tanks back.?
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"or be able to buy more with coins.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"all the fish's eggs should be displayed under one head, instead of various categories and also the selling star rating should be displayed
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"takes too long to move up levels though
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"great app try to purchase fish bucks though other apps but, still waiting the only bad thing
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"but i do think a 12 hr breeding time for a total of 90 fish to breed is a bit long for shorter event time.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"im in love with this game, but fish bucks need to go i hate that.
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"live wallpaper needs to be fixed also : (
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"the new event is not giving me the prize when i bred my fish and 11 hours thats a little to long to be able to get everything.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"changed from 5 stars because the new valentines event takes 12hrs to breed and 6 days to complete.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"this game is so  fun except tht the baby fish take for ever to grow
",info
lentwentysix,ratingthree,"i like the game save ur bucks their hard to come by seem like they want u 2 use cash to advance other than that good game
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"i like the events, but sometimes it kind of stinks when you don't have the fish bucks for them.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"and you really don't have good deals for fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"love this game, but i wish there was an easier way to transfer game from one phone to the next.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"never succewd open even the internet connection available and in a hi speed wifi.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"this game takes up the most space on my phone.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"the graphics and fonts overlap!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"but wish the fish weren't so expensive or cost so many fish bucks
",info
lenninetyfive,ratingfive,"i love playing tapfish and wanna thank u for retrieving the coins i couldn't get but i really wish i wouldn't of lost all my tanks and all the work i had in this game for the past yr i lost a lot of tanks and fish that took days to earn and the money spent while i played .but i had to get a replacement phone ,same phone just wish i wouldst of lost all that i worked hard for should be a way to not loose games that would b awesome !
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i want alot of fish bucks for free please
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"game not bad, but you start off slow.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"wish there was an easier way to get coins and cash.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"joys of fun only downfalls is it takes forever to level up and fish cost way to much fish bucks.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"not easy trying to earn fish bucks without actually spending real money.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"it is very show moving store to i don't want to spend real money to get fish bucks.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"it takes a long time to accumulate bucks to buy things or to speed up the breeding process.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i just wished that i could earn fish bucks faster
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"need more fish bucks free!
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
",info
lenfive,ratingtwo,"good game but constantly crashes.!
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"cool just wish you got fish bucks often
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"i still can't breed mystery fish.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfive,"ilove this game and so does my 3 yr old grandson he always asks gamma can i play fish with you only problem is when i changed phones i lost it all but it is fun rebuilding
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"some of the valentine species are a bit odd though!
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"should get more free fish bucks though
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"very addicting and time comsuming but it could use more ways to earn fish bucks.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"my only complaints are that we should be able to still get our prizes from events even after the event is over.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"the other thing is that you should have like bubbles or something pop up so we can earn xp, fb or coins.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingtwo,"the valentine game is way too long,12 hours to breed, so no way to get half way through ribbing three breeding tanks.
",info
lenfour,ratingtwo,"note the disappearing bucks.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"the fish bucks are too hard to get.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"its fun with all the cute fish but i wish there were more events because they are fun
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"during updates & events, i was losing my daily prizes & my free spin on the 5th day.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"i love it just want more bucks rewards
",info
lenfiftytwo,ratingfive,"it's a really addictive game i love it but it keeps crashing my phone it always tells me to force close some of the breedable fish are to expensive and it's hard to get fish bucks without having to buy them with ur own cash ain't doing it uninstalled! !
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks and more breedables for coins
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"if you could buy more fish bucks using just fish coins thatd be awesome.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"fun game don't like the fact that you have use real money to buy fishbuck
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"slow to load but addictive
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"good but taking days to grow fish
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"or be able to buy more with coins.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"umm its trying to make me use my brothers acount to buy fish bucks ither than that good
",info
lennine,ratingone,"doesn't save and won't let me uninstall
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"wish it was free instead of pay credit card.lame.don't download this game at all.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"populate tanks as you wish for fun or to unlock new fish & decorations.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
",info
lensix,ratingthree,"decent game,tough to earn fishbucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"love it but somtices it forcefully close
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"wish it didn't take forever to level up though.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"would give 5 stars but its slow loading different things.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"the only issue i have with this game is that it can be quite expensive!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"it takes forever to earn ""fish bucks"" and almost everything requires you to use them for purchases, speed ups, most decorations, etc.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"so real but hard to get fish bucks!
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingone,"to pass a quest you need to buy a fish that cost 49 fishbucks and at the end you could sell it but its only worth some coins i thinking in removing game i dont recommend this game.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"been playing for like a year now the only thing that bothers me is the fish bucks it should be easier to get them and less fish bucks for fish and items!
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"i gave it a five but i think events should last a little longer so that you get a chance to comlete them.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"one other thing is some items shouldn't cost so much and you should have more chances to earn fishbucks.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"too hard to earn fish bucks/dollars and too many $$ only items.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"reasonable price for extra coins and $$ but should be able to do all things without sending $$ with ads displayed.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"you gotta have fish bucks for a lot of things.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"you can only get fish bucks by buying it or clicking their ads.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"i can't open tapfish since update.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i love the game but wish it was easier to get fish bucks and quicker
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"just wish once you wished a certain level you could buy mystery breedables with coins and not just fish bucks
",info
lenthree,ratingtwo,"stores stuff needlessly.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"have to clear data and restore game periodically in order to free up memory.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"restore sometimes installs data that is 5+ days out of date, so progress is lost.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i think it would be nice to earn fish bucks in other ways.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"may be you could buy fish bucks with your coins, charge us a sum of coins you couldbuy fish bucks.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"the graphics and fonts overlap!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"fish bucks need to be easier to receive though.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"the only thing preventing the fifth star is that some people are able to 'cheat' by rooting their phones and giving themselves unlimited bucks.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"like very much but wish fish bucks were easier to get.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"it lags a bit and takes awhile to level up, but it's still entertaining.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfour,"just if it were easier to get bucks, i would have gave it 5 stars.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"need 2 come way down on all prices & giv out a lot mor gold & fish bucks!
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"i love it but the new quest game is so dumb why the f$!k cant u earn fishbucks instead of coins i have over 4million coins i need bucks.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"i had to restart due to accidental tank deleting.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"we should have our stuff returned not deleted!
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"where are my fish bucks  i did what they told me but disnt received fish buckz
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"addictive, still a little glitchy and epensive
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"but memory it takes up is a joke.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"just wish u didn't have to buy fish bums for a lot of ur tasks.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love the game i just wish there was a easier way to get fish bucks.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"i am getting a new phone and i hope i will be able to keep my tap fish progress.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"is there anything that i can do to transfer my progress to my new phone?
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i do not want to loose my fish, 300,000 + coins and my earned bucks.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"between forced closes, freezing, & constant charging fishbucks for most items required for quests, i'm just done.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"i just wish it wasn't so hard to get extra fish bucks without having to buy them.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"a good fun game but the free stuff gets boring very fast and requires real money to buy more stuff
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"it's need to help make money faster
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"wud like easier ways 2 earn fish bucks
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"this is a goid game but i wish you didnt have to buy the fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfive,"so far tapfish is going good i just dont like it when you have to wait for the fish bucks
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"would be 5 but u need cash for almost everything.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"got up to level 60 and lost all my progress.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"it takes forever to level up and get enough coins to buy the stuff you want for your tanks.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"just wish it were easier to earn fish bucks.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfour,"great game but if level up is going to be so slow fish bucks should be easier to earn or buy.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"for some reason i can't even purchase fish bucks (error).
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"force closes alot but still love it.....
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"love this game, would rate higher but after about 3 weeks it now is telling me that i have to connect to the internet.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingone,"lower the prices on things have an income of money if done 5 stars
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"not a bad game, but annoyingly slow
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"its totally fun and addicting but you run out of fish bucks and  coins to easily
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"fun needs more ways to win prizes.
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"cheaper fish
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"this game had great graphics and a wide variety of different fish, but you needed a lot of ""fish bucks"" to buy most of the ones you need for your achievements.
",info
lenfortyfive,ratingfour,"i am addicted to playing it but i wish you could earn more fish bucks more easily cause i am now stuck and can't complete any task without any fish bucks and can't get any fish bucks cause i can't complete tasks
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"just wish the really cool fish and accessories weren't quite so expensive.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"would be nice if it was easier to get fish bucks.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingone,"it can be fun but using the new version and it still loses your money.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"this app stole  75 bucks beware of this app,  it locks up,  and or is  glitchy the (game) will stell your hard earned money from you.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingone,"go ahead and buy fish bucks, or download the apps they want you to try to earn bucks, and have a fish burp good bye fish bucks.
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"and refuse to replace missing buck's.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"would be 5 stars if adverts did'nt keep on popping up and the coins and fish bucks were all free
",info
lentwelve,ratingone,"new year event start on ios devices but not on android devices?
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"we just hate waiting on breed process ;)
",info
lenthirtynine,ratingfour,"pretty fun to play for awhile but tedious must keep up with it on a daily basis in order to receive full benefit will need to purchase fish bucks so if your cheap this isn't game for you
",info
lenseventyseven,ratingfive,"but sucks because it says you can earn fishbucks by downloading apps and doing other things when it doesn't its such a joke you can't get anywhere in this game without the fishbucks, and if it freezes my phone up again, im done with it, ive had to start over several times in this game, have, thought bout buying fishbucks but i will be damned if i pay for something that will just be lost!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingthree,"the game is great except i got a new phone and couldn't transfer it over so i had to start over.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"also it keeps stopping and closing for no reason.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
",info
lenfortyone,ratingthree,"i found a better fish game with cuter fish i got tired of this game force closing and i cant seem to make enough fish bucks to keep my fish alive i got really bored but it was fun for awhile
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"love it just try giving more free fish bucks as prizes.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"have yet to have a force close.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"well, its good but it takes too long to breed and u can only do one at a time
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"but it's getting very frustrating with it closing down constantly.
",info
lenforty,ratingthree,"i have a suggestion also for breeding is it possible to do the same on both sets of breeding where if there's only certain fish that can breed together that all the others disappear like the mystery tanks do??
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingthree,"it's gotten better not sure if it's from upgrades you've done or that i've upgraded my phone which by the way for some reason could not get my old game
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"just wish i started off with more fishbucks
",info
lenforty,ratingfive,"in the last few days though i've noticed that the fish aren't swimming smoothly like they usually do, don't know if it needs an update i've tried logging out and in but its still doing it.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"i love it but i wish the fish didn't take so long to grow up
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"just wish you didn't have wait so long for the fish to breed.
",info
lenfour,ratingfive,"why is tapfish disabled
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"this game could have better information,help,better upgrade on this tapfish game,better news,no pay credit is lousy.
",info
lennine,ratingone,":-( after the latest android update.my 70 tanks are gone.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"it only lets me breed 2 fish in the mystery breeds.

lenthirteen,ratingfour,"the only thing i frown on is the most stuff cost fish bucks.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingtwo,"when ever i try to breed, the fish are there but whenever i tap on them it only gives me one to breed when there are several there.
",info
lennine,ratingtwo,"i can't visit any of my neighbor tanks....
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"i think you shuld make a place where you can change fish mony into fish buks and fish buks into fish mony.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"then after that update it wunt let me play the missions.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingtwo,"after this last event i can't breed and i lost a lot of fish.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"after this latest update three tanks of fish are missing an i can no longer breed fish.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingone,"when i went to play and i had my breeding tank  ready to put the fish in tank they was gone .
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"just wish events were easier to make your goals.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"some of the fish too expensive to buy but overly i adore this game.
",info
lenfortynine,ratingfour,"or such things it does make things go by a little bit faster breeding does take a little too long i think right now i'm waiting 2 days that's a bit long and i'm not spending money sorry i have a baby that needs my money first.
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"wish fish bucks were easier to get.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"i had one issue where i had to delete my second tank but other than that its been awesome
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"its not excellent because its hard to get money and still have fish.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"epic game ever but give ways to get more fish bucks easier :)
",info
lenfour,ratingfour,"also, make prices lower
",info
lenthirtyfive,ratingfour,"love it wish the tanks were a little cheaper and wish they would have more ways to earn fish bucks instead of having to pay once they do that it will be a 5 star app
",info
lennine,ratingone,"it takes forever to level up on this game.
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"i play on my ipod and would really like to be able to transfer my game to my android.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"but why is it so slow and small on my motorola atrix..
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"i purchased 2 20 fish bucks packages in the last couple weeks and neither showed up.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"i just wish it didn't freeze so much and there was an easier way to get coins
",info
lenseven,ratingone,"beginner game started up & will not restore.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"i have did the earn free bucks and have not received any thing
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"per tapfish ""somehow my tapfish went corrupt & start the game over"".
",info
lentwentynine,ratingfive,"apart from it popping up telling me to leave 5*s all the time its a good game, wish there was more things to do without paying real money though..
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"it could be little better if there is a way to cash in coins for bucks  or at least easy way to get free bucks ...
",info
lenfiftyone,ratingfive,"okay here's another idea space theme astronaut fish and it makes aliens a spaceship decoration and planets and space backgrounds and space decorations and meteor shower that moves and a moon that turns or the earth mini solar system for a reward and rockets and moon rovers and flying saucers.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"there should be more events once one is over.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"good game but it can be slow at progressing
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"i lost everything that i spent over a year doing.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"its a brilliant game until it starts freezing and forcing close but the kids do love it.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfive,"i luv this game but it takes days to hatch most eggs and u have to spend money to complete tasks, but it is a free game, ppl have 2 make money!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"it would be nice if we could purchase more than one item at a time, rather than going back and forth for same item.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"it never fetches data from server cant able to play it till now...:(
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"i really like the game but am disapointed that most of the objects you need or want to buy must be bought with fish bucks other than that grea game
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"wish there were more fish bucks rewards though.
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"good game overall but eats memory so far
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"good game but crashes alot
",info
lenthirtyeight,ratingfour,"breeding takes to long and more breeding tanks cost too much but this is a great game i'm 35 and all my kids love it from 5 ye old to 7, 11,and 15 ye old ty for a fun addictive game!
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"can't play for more than a few minutes before it force closes.
",info
leneleven,ratingone,"per tapfish ""somehow my tapfish went corrupt & start the game over"".
",info
leneight,ratingone,"always hangs and consumes a lot of memory..
",info
lentwo,ratingfive,"add tadpoles!! :)
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"i have more then ten of all 4 frog breads why cant i claim the 7th collection item?
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingthree,"i have 2 limited breedable fish and when i try to breed them it is saying i don't have any limited breedable fish somebody please fix this so that i can breed my fish?
",info
leneighteen,ratingthree,"but for the last week every time i turn on the app, it freezes my touch screen up.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingtwo,"and all of the other fish cost fish bucks while its already so hard to get coins!
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"need 2 be able 2 get more things  easier like fish bucks...
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"uninstalled kept force closing on me and i lost everything..
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"i've played this on 2 phones now and i wish my old fish had followed from apple to android...
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"rebuilding my collection of fish is gonna be expensive,  wish it was possible to buy buck fish for higher coin prices or earn bucks easier.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"bubble tips get on my nerves ...
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"pop up to many times.
",info
lentwentynine,ratingone,"aware but no help - the bubble-pop event ended two months ago & i have 24 half-evolved fish-bubbles flashing-red & i can't pop, sell, kill or delete them.
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"this game suckes don't install its a rip off this company just wants your money
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"can there be a way to trade coins for bucks please!
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingone,"fish bucks are to hard to get and to buy the good breedable fish you have to use alot of your hard earned fish bucks
",info
lenfortytwo,ratingthree,"i was on level 12, then had to reset my phone to get a new phone, switched out my sd card, memory card, and battery (yes i saved data before removal) placed everything in my new phone, and it started from the beginning.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"having the same problem as everyone else, can't even access game now.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"it's a bit slow sometimes on my metropcs optimus m, but could be my phone's fault.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.
",info
leneleven,ratingtwo,"i have gotten a data parsing error for the second time.
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"runs a little slow sometimes.
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"actually five times to be exact when the submarine was filled to the max n several other times when i only had a few items.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"dont last long bucuz everything is so high to buy with fish bucks!!
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"breeding time should be shortened too.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"fun but shuts down frequently
",info
lenfortyeight,ratingfive,"would be five stars but the fish inch across the screen and it lags when i try to bring up a menu or anything but when i have a menu brought up the fish swim smoothly instead of inching but if the lag was fixed it would be 5stars!!!
",info
lenfive,ratingfour,"just started getting error messages.
",info
lenseven,ratingtwo,"the game constantly freezes and force closes.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"and it would be nice if i could chat with a friend who is using an i phone.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"lower prices please
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfive,"but when i had to change phones i lost everything and couldn't remember my account cause i had it for so long.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"well only one problem and its to hard to earn fish bucks ples fix it i love the game so i will give 5 stars
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingthree,"i love tha game but it started me all over twice & gave me fish bucks like that part but starting all over again i don't like
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"lots of fun to play but does crash sometimes on my droid 2
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"would like to be able to earn  more fish bucks!
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"you get 1300 fish bucks for $100.
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"love the game, just wish you got more bucks to buy the more exotic fish as you are very ltd with coins
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"wish it was cheaper and faster the backgrounds are too expensive!
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"would giv mre stars bt is always shutn phne dwn bc of phne temp gts 2 hot!
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"this is a great game but certain functions like cleaning the tank don't work well on a phone...
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"with a few adjustments like making it easier to get cash and coins as well as the cleaning problem this would be an amazing game
",info
lennineteen,ratingfour,"the only downside is that more than half the fish are only available thru in-game purchase of fishbucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"the fish cost to much and they made up half the fishes names
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"i love the breeding events the best though, don't really like the submarine ones :/
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"its upsetting thoughwhen u get a new phone, there is no way to transfer the game.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"also hard to earn fish bucks.
",info
lenthirty,ratingfive,"why does it stop working for no reason, on my motorola droid razr maxx, and now it wont connect me into the game, fix please, i love my fish game!!
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfive,"still on daily bonus all i get is coins needs 2 b more fish bucks added and/or fish coins aren't doin me any good right now.
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingtwo,"get ffree fish with purchase of tank bucks is quite unfair to those of us who cant afford to spend $$ when new fish are avail for breeding.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"it would be a welcomed improvement to have the occasional reward of a fish buck or two.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"maybe its my phone bt the fish bucks needs more fixing.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"then into the last 2 days my pearls were stolen or it would say i had two clams and then only let me buy 1.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfive,"this is a five star game as long as the parsing error is really fixed.
",info
lensix,ratingfour,"needs 2 have easier ways 2 get fishbucks.
",info
lenthree,ratingfive,"keeps force closing
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"bucks that it should be easier to win them in the events play.
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"but needs to have a way to earn more fish bucks instead of buying them...
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"too limited options on pairing fish bought with fish bucks and coins.
",info
lenthirtysix,ratingfive,"this game is awesome only problem u have to pay 4 fish bucks i haven't used all mine yet but i am really low on them otherwise this game is great any1 who puts 1 star is crazy
",info
lenthree,ratingfour,"progress is slow.
",info
lentwenty,ratingfour,"gr8 app passes some time away but i dnt like every time i open the app i get a pop up
",info
lentwentyseven,ratingfour,"it is slower and the fish and decorations are smaller but tapfish keeps improving it so hopefully soon it is just as good as the iphone version.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"last quest had a ridiculous amount of monsters
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"crashes a lot but still worth it
",info
lenfortyone,ratingfour,"this game for me right now is a four star game, but if they lower the fish prices and if sometimes they would also give you fish bucks when you sell a fish, it will totally be a five start game!!:)
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingthree,"this sucks cause im at a low level and need to breed the neon tetra but can't get it cause it wont level up.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"was working now the server wont connect and if it does it takes 5 mins to do so..
",info
lenthirtythree,ratingthree,"i have also lost lots of my fish bucks to revive my fish becos wen it force close i forget and where i left off, i come back, all my fish are dead.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"what happens to our app when one changes her phone, ie to another andriod?
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingone,"i worked so hard to level up and get my tanks only to get on this afternoon to find that everything reset.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"would be nice to get more breedable fish without having to pay real cash for em.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"i just wish it were easier to get fish bucks .....
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"simply because all the cool stuff you can only get with fish bucks....
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"apparently there is a problem with the transactions going through or something.....
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"but other than the fish bucks problem.....
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"love it best game ever other then sometimes slow
",info
lentwentyone,ratingthree,"i have an xmas event which i only got 3 xmas fish until the main breeding fish disappeared from my breeding tank.
",info
lenseven,ratingthree,"so now i cant play the event...
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"not only that i also played the  egyptian events and also found i couldnt claim my gifts from it...
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"i think these events need sorting out properly.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"this game is ok needs better graphics, and people should be able to earn more fish bucks more easily.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"now i have to get more bucks to revive them!
",info
lentwentynine,ratingthree,"it is a nice game for my 3 year old but it is very addictive and requires the purchase of fish bucks to really get any where in the game.
",info
lensixteen,ratingfour,"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks n some fish weren't so expensive
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"great except the stupid fish bucks feature, that makes you either buy them or download apps.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"i'd play more if it was a little cheaper.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"also that bubble needs to go, it interferes and gets in the way..
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfive,"would be great if the makers of this game could come up with mini games to play in the game to get free fish bucks.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"should have easier ways to earn fish bucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfive,"fun game fish are to expensive tho
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"good game some parts run aa lil slow..
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingthree,"best one out yet n love how i can set as wallpaper only if it would quit force close all the time would b 5 *
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"with this game  but howcome i sale the with bucks only coins you need to upgrade it
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"only thing that i don't like is that getting fish bucks is so hard.
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"the only thing i feel could use some improvement, are the few and far between chances you get to earn or win tapfish dollars.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"me personally,i would make it just a bit easier and not so random ,to win dollars.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
",info
lentwentyfive,ratingfour,"why in the event that their is they dont give me what i collect i have to keep doing it all over in my cellphone
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"it's good but wish it was easier to get fish bucks
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"i love this game i have been playing it for years, unfortunately i had to get a new phone so i lost everything i had before, but its still a great stress relief game
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"i just wish the breading was a little faster and you didn't have to spend 12 fish bucks to speed up a breed!
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"just wish earning fish bucks wasn't so hard.
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"just wish the thing on the bottom left corner would load.
",info
lennine,ratingfive,"ever since i updated the game it wont load.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"just wish you could earn more fish bucks easier
",info
lenfortynine,ratingfive,"i've just completed the breeding event that gives the firework background on the new years event, but when i go to get it from the item store it doesn't say 0 coins like all the other event backgrounds, it's asking me for 70 odd fish bucks for it...
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"it works some times but at times it very slow
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"wish you could convert coins to fish bucks.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"i cant play the special events, so whats the point of playing at all.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"game for closes tanks size much bigger can't fetch data and lags!!!!
",info
leneleven,ratingfive,"most of my fish have disapered since i have updated it
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"most recent update has caused me to not be able to breed any of my fish.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingone,"i also lost the entire tank of the christmas fish that took me a week to breed!
",info
lennineteen,ratingtwo,"really liked this game, have for ages but i updated it and now i have lost 3/4 of my fish. :(
",info
lensix,ratingone,"i lost almost all my fish ?????????
",info
lenfourteen,ratingone,"as soon as the latest update was finished loading,half my fish were gone!
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfour,"fun glitchy and game rips off your fishbucks from time to time also support doesn't refund them everytime they should but still fun
",info
lenseventeen,ratingfive,"wish it was easier to get more fish bucks or use coins to get the bettr fish.
",info
leneight,ratingfive,"i love tapfish but the bubble is anoying.
",info
lennineteen,ratingthree,"my only problem is that when i don't have internet for a few days all my fish die.
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"it would be awesome if you could save to an sd card
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingone,"this last update does not allow me to clean the tanks so all my tanks are at 65% happy. i gave made no changes to my tanks but the update caused this.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"should lower fish prices or give more free fish bucks...
",info
lenfortythree,ratingtwo,"tried to buy frog egg in the event for coins and it chraged me fish bucks instead several times and can only restore twice isn't fair i worked hard for those fish bucks please fix 3 stars deducted will go to 5 when fixed

lentwenty,ratingfive,"when i double tap on fish in event it wont she me how far my fish is from being complete
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfive,"i have my tanks for two day and i like it so far, i'm waiting for more ways to make money...
",info
leneight,ratingone,"no doubt all my fish are dead too!!
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"its very irritating not to have enough fish bucks, you should allow us to earn it..
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"fun game but if your phone dies you have to start from scratch.
",info
lenthirtyone,ratingfour,"the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes it refuses to start and i have to reboot my tablet to get it to work which can be annoying.
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"needs more ways to win fish cash but good game
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"please make available to exchange the money on game for fish bucks
",info
lensixteen,ratingtwo,"it's rather decent, but the animations/graphics are rather sloppy and breeding is very slow.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingtwo,"it's also hard to sort through the fish types in the shop.
",info
lenthirtytwo,ratingfive,"this game is great but when i set as wall paper i see half tank at my wall paper and blue at button i use htc inspire 4g but anyways i love it ^_^
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
",info
lensix,ratingfive,"slow play when you start out.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"fun game, been having hours of enjoyment but started to force close regularly which is very frustrating.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"still wish prices w fish bucks werent so high.
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i really like this game, but the rates are expensive.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"pretty and fun, great time killer but wears on the battery
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"pretty kool but i lost my name and tanks when i had to reset my tablet that sucks
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"wish it was easier to get fishbucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingtwo,"got a new phone and now everytime i play i have to re download the app or it wont let.
",info
lenten,ratingtwo,"im getting nowhere restoring to same spot over and over.
",info
lenten,ratingone,"i have just installed this game, straight away it crashed.
",info
lensix,ratingone,"rubbish it keeps crashing on me

lenfifteen,ratingfive,"game love t so much fish bucks are a little high but its worth it
",info
lenthree,ratingthree,"always force closing
",info
leneight,ratingthree,"its koo but it gets stuck a lot!!
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"i love this but getting bucks only to hard pls make this as easier ....
",info
lentwelve,ratingfive,"amazing but needs more events but get it downloaded,best game ever!!!
",info
lenfiftyseven,ratingfive,"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks. if those were easier i would play more often and i would actually buy them because i know i would be able to earn more after i blow through them so quickly because of the steep prices.
",info
lenthirtyseven,ratingfive,"i also read that there are some quests u must pay cash for and you can not skip it. we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"fix the ease of collecting coins, fish bucks, and lower prices in the store and it would be even more fun.
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"but it's hard to level up and gather up some bucks...
",info
lenseven,ratingfour,"love game but freezes on daily spin
",info
lensixteen,ratingfive,"it would be nice if you could earn fish bucks with some of the breeding fish.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"haven't had many problems with it forcing close since the update though.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"fun game but needs to be easier to earn fish bucks and the events need to start sooner...
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"3 of my favorite fishes to buy and sell are all gone.
",info
lennine,ratingfour,"da big icons and the bubble r so rediculous!
",info
lentwelve,ratingfour,"but i ddnt like the way it looks at my toshiba tablet.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingfour,"its cool but it gets too repetitive there needs to be something more in between the growing, selling and breeding of the fishes.
",info
lenseventeen,ratingthree,"the only thing its missing is more fish,room and fish bucks its great but sometimes boring!
",info
lenfifteen,ratingfour,"fun but not enough to do everything takes so long. breeding, growing and so on
",info
lenten,ratingfour,"i like this a lot, but force closes soooo often
",info
lennineteen,ratingfive,"i love this game but it would be great if you could use your coins to buy fish bucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfive,"even if it would be 10,000 coins for one fish buck, it would ma
",info
lensixteen,ratingthree,"force closes wayyyy too much with new version on droid x, esp with the new event.
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"always his issues loading too.
",info
lensix,ratingtwo,"soooooo smaallllll cant read the letters.....
",info
leneighteen,ratingfive,"only issue, my events and submarine ride options have completely disappeared and i'm not happy about that.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingthree,"bt now the thing thats keepin me from fully enjoyin it is the money..
",info
lenfifteen,ratingthree,"it seems we can get coins by the bunches bt we cant get fish bucks.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingthree,"mostly evrythin in the store is able to be bought by fish bucks.
",info
lentwenty,ratingthree,"and now i cant even play the new egyptian dive thing, it jus takes me back to my home screen.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"maybe its my phone bt the fish bucks needs more fixing.
",info
lenfourteen,ratingfive,"only downfall is when i got my new phone i lost my previous game
",info
lentwentyfour,ratingfive,"tapfish is a nice game but when it come to the bucks i a problem since i have no i have to wait 3 day.
",info
lenthirteen,ratingfour,"also if you pay for bucks you only get coins when you sell.
",info
leneight,ratingfour,"if you could earn bucks that would help.
",info
leneleven,ratingfour,"and if they got their time straight that would help too...
",info
lenthirtyfour,ratingfive,"just wish there was a way to trade in coins for fish bucks. don't like having to buy them in order to get the fish i need for trophies or challenges in breeding.
",info
lentwentyeight,ratingfour,"should be able to earn fishbucks easier or at least make some of the fish cheaper other than that seems like a pretty long term game not bad
",info
lenfive,ratingthree,"but it force closes alot!
",info
lenten,ratingfive,"anyone else having problems when trying to view your quests?
",info
lenfive,ratingfive,"app keeps crashing every time.

lenfourteen,ratingtwo,"enjoying playing tap fish but constant force closes on quests beginning to get frustrating.
",info
lentwentythree,ratingone,"i'm changing my rating from 5 to 1 because i can't play any of the events without it up forcing me to close!
",info
lentwentytwo,ratingfour,"wish you could convert coins to bucks, or when you buy a fish for bucks you sell it for bucks, not coins...
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"this is the best android game i have played and the only problem is u have to pay to get fishbucks.
",info
lenfour,ratingthree,"fish die too quickly.
",info
lennine,ratingthree,"expensive breedables but all in all, a good game.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"forced forecloses all the time sad because this game is awesome
",info
lensixteen,ratingone,"having issues with the game, i have not once been able to do a dive mission.
",info
lennine,ratingone,"game keep kicking me out every time i try.
",info
leneighteen,ratingfour,"this is a fun game and the kids enjoy it too, sometimes forces close but usual runs good.
",info
lentwentyone,ratingfive,"i only wish that wen i accidently deleted the app wen i got it bac i didnt hav to start over
",info
lentwelve,ratingthree,"just they need more free fish bucks, instead of objects not needed.
",info
leneleven,ratingthree,"i wish it wasn't so dependent on spending real money.
",info
lenten,ratingthree,"game shuts down alot but other than that its great.

",info
lentwentynine,ratingfour,"would give it 5 stars, but on my xperia mini pro the home button when visiting neighbours is really small, and i end up clicking objects rather than the button.

lenthirty,ratingfive,"the game is absolutely enthralling, only it would be nice if the in-game clock didn't run absolutely off of real time due to thr fish breeding and ageing.
",info
